The **EarlyGrainFilling** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **EndPodInitiation** to **MidGrainFilling**. This phase marks the beginning of the grain filling period when seeds start to accumulate dry matter rapidly.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **EndPodInitiation** and **MidGrainFilling** stages.

- This phase starts at **EndPodInitiation** and ends at **MidGrainFilling**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Early Grain Filling Process

During early grain filling:

- Seeds begin rapid accumulation of starch, protein, and other reserves
- Grain filling rate is typically highest during this phase
- Seeds increase in size and weight substantially
- Assimilate demand by grains is very high
- Source-sink relationships strongly influence grain growth

## Target Thermal Time

The target thermal time for this phase is dynamically adjusted based on the duration of the [Pod Initiation](PodInitiation.qmd) phase:

$$
\text{Target} = T_{\text{max}} - \frac{TT_{\text{PodInit}}}{2}
$$

Where:
- $T_{\text{max}}$ = Maximum early grain filling duration (300 °Cd by default)
- $TT_{\text{PodInit}}$ = Total thermal time accumulated during the Pod Initiation phase

$\text{Target}$ is capped at zero to prevent negative durations.
