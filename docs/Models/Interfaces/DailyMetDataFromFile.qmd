The DailyMetDataFromFile class is a data structure that encapsulates a complete set of daily meteorological observations. It serves as a container for weather data read from weather files and provides structured access to individual meteorological variables.

## Overview

DailyMetDataFromFile is a serializable class that extends the Model base class and stores all meteorological variables for a single day. This class is used throughout APSIM NG to pass weather data between components and is particularly important for accessing weather information from adjacent days (yesterday and tomorrow) through the IWeather interface.

The class provides a standardized format for daily weather data, ensuring consistency across different weather data sources and simplifying the process of reading and storing meteorological observations. It includes both commonly used standard variables (temperature, rainfall, radiation) and less common variables (diffuse fraction, air pressure) that may be required by specialized models.
