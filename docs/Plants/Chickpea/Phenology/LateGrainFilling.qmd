The **LateGrainFilling** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **LateGrainFilling** to **EndGrainFill**. This phase represents the final portion of the grain filling period when seeds approach their maximum dry weight.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **LateGrainFilling** and **EndGrainFill** stages.

- This phase starts at **LateGrainFilling** and ends at **EndGrainFill**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Late Grain Filling Process

During late grain filling:

- Grain filling rate declines as seeds approach maximum weight
- Seeds undergo final stages of reserve accumulation
- Moisture content in seeds begins to decline
- Most leaves have senesced
- The crop is approaching physiological maturity

## Physiological Changes

At this final filling stage:

- **Declining filling rate**: Rate of dry matter accumulation decreases
- **Limited photosynthesis**: Reduced leaf area limits current assimilate production
- **Reserve depletion**: Stem reserves are largely exhausted
- **Seed desiccation begins**: Seeds start to lose moisture

## Cultivar-Specific Parameters

| Name       | Description                                         | Default Value |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| [Phenology].LateGrainFilling.Target   | Thermal time for late grain filling (°Cd) | Cultivar-specific |

## Environmental Factors

Late grain filling is affected by:

1. **Terminal drought**: Common in many chickpea growing regions
2. **High temperatures**: Can accelerate senescence and shorten filling duration
3. **Frost risk**: Late frosts can damage filling seeds in some regions
4. **Disease**: Late-season diseases have less impact as filling concludes

## Practical Considerations

During late grain filling:

- Avoid premature harvest before grain fill is complete
- Monitor crops for signs of approaching maturity (yellowing, pod color)
- Consider desiccation timing if planning pre-harvest desiccation
- Plan harvest equipment and logistics
- Monitor weather forecasts for harvest timing

The completion of late grain filling marks physiological maturity when seeds have reached their maximum dry weight. Further time on the plant is mainly for seed drying to facilitate harvest.
