The `SimpleLeafAppearancePhase` represents a phenological phase where the duration of the phase is determined by the number of new leaves appearing to match final leaf number. 


## Overview

`SimpleLeafAppearancePhase` models a phenological phase that progresses based on final leaf number. It is a simplified approach to leaf appearance, where the phase completes when the number of leaves reaches final leaf number. This phase is useful for crops where leaf appearance is a key developmental milestone.

## Inputs

- `Start`: Name of the phenological stage where the phase begins (string).
- `End`: Name of the phenological stage where the phase ends (string).
- `IsEmerged`: Boolean value indicating whether the phase starts after emergence.
- `TargetLeafNumber`: A child `IFunction` that provides the target leaf number for the phase.
- `CurrentLeafNumber`: A child `IFunction` that returns the current number of leaves.

## Methodology

The `SimpleLeafAppearancePhase` progresses from the `Start` to the `End` stage based on the number of leaves that have appeared. On the first day, it stores the current number of leaves as `LeafNoAtStart` and computes the `TargetLeafForCompletion` by subtracting this from the final target leaf number, i.e. further changes of Final Leaf Number (i.e. `TargetLeafNumber`) will not impact the completion criteria.

If the leaf number reaches the target leaf number, the phase is considered complete and the model proceeds to the next phase.
