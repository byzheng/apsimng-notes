Cereal Anthesis Molecular Phenology (CAMP) model is based on the Kirby Framework which assumes the timing of anthesis is a result of the timing of flag leaf and an additional thermal time passage from there to heading then anthesis. It also assumes the timing of flag leaf is a result of the Final Leaf Number (which sets a target) and leaf appearance rate (which sets the rate of progress toward the target). Leaf appearance rate is a function of Thermal time and a genotype specific Phyllochron which changes with Haun stage as described by [@jamieson_sirius:_1998].


Master model, **[CAMP](CAMP.qmd)**, is the main entry point for the Cereal Anthesis Molecular Phenology model in APSIM NG. Others are the submodels required by CAMP.

The table below lists the submodels that are required by CAMP:
