The [Phenology](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phenology.qmd) model in APSIM NG simulates the development of barley plants.


## Thermal Time

Daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd) is based on [XYPairs](/docs/Models/Functions/XYPairs.qmd) function with base temperature of 4°C and optimum temperature of 26°C.

## Photoperiod

The daily photoperiod is calculated using the [PhotoperiodFunction](/docs/Models/Functions/PhotoperiodFunction.qmd) with 6 degrees twilight. 

## Vernalisation

Barley development is influenced by vernalisation, with [VrnSensitivity](Variables.qmd#vrnsensitivity) determining the reduction in leaf number as vernalisation accumulates. The [DailyVernalisation](Variables.qmd#dailyvernalisation) is calculated based on thermal time and temperature response.
