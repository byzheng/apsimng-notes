The **LateGrainFilling** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **LateGrainFilling** to **EndGrainFill**. This phase represents the final portion of the grain filling period when seeds approach their maximum dry weight.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **LateGrainFilling** and **EndGrainFill** stages.

- This phase starts at **LateGrainFilling** and ends at **EndGrainFill**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Late Grain Filling Process

During late grain filling:

- Grain filling rate declines as seeds approach maximum weight
- Seeds undergo final stages of reserve accumulation
- Moisture content in seeds begins to decline
- Most leaves have senesced
- The crop is approaching physiological maturity
