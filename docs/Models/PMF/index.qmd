Plant Modeling Framework (PMF) offers a modular library of plant organ and process submodels. This design allows for dynamic assembly of complex crop models, by integrating components like photosynthesis and leaf development without additional coding [@brown_plant_2014].


### Arbitrator

[Arbitrator](Arbitrator/index.qmd) is responsible for allocating resources (mainly biomass and nitrogen) among different organs of a plant (e.g., leaves, stem, roots, grain). Its role is central to simulating plant growth and development realistically.

### Phenology

[Phenology](Phenology/index.qmd) is responsible for simulating developmental stages of a plantâ€”from emergence to flowering, grain filling, and maturity.
