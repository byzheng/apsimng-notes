    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nThe Weather model in APSIM contains a CO2 property, which determines the atmospheric CO₂ concentration used in crop growth and development calculations. This property is normally updated with each day’s weather data.\nBy subscribing to the PreparingNewWeatherData event, the script intercepts the process before daily weather values are applied. This allows you to override the CO₂ value dynamically for the duration of the simulation.\nThis approach is particularly useful for experiments involving elevated CO₂ or simulating long-term climate change effects where static weather files are used but require changes in CO₂ independently."

The model uses a sub-daily interpolation method to estimate air temperatures at three hourly interpolation method (ThreeHourAirTemperature), then applies a three cardinal temperature function to each interpolated temperature. These values are averaged to give a daily thermal time used in phenological and growth calculations.\n\nInterpolationMethod: ThreeHourAirTemperature is used for sub-daily interpolation, i.e. 3-hourly temperature estimates.\nResponse: Three cardinal temperature using XYPairs to define the temperature response function. This function determines how effective the temperature is for thermal time accumulation (Whish et al. 2020; Robertson and Lilley 2016).\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Point\nDescription\nValue (°C)\n\n\n\n\nBase\nMinimum for growth\n2\n\n\nOptimum\nMaximum rate of growth\n30\n\n\nMaximum\nGrowth ceases above this\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThermal Time Function with Three Cardinal Temperatures",

This model is a key part of the crop’s phenology (developmental timing), which is crucial for understanding when the plant will reach important stages like flowering and grain filling.\nLeaf appearance rate is influenced by temperature (how warm it is), the plant’s stage of development (which leaf is appearing), and the length of the day (photoperiod).

Instead, it changes depending on the leaf’s position on the plant and the day length.\nThe effective phyllochron (\\(P_{\\text{eff}}\\)) is calculated as:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{eff}} = P_{\\text{base}} \\times f_{\\text{leaf}}(n) \\times f_{\\text{pp}}(d)\n\\]\n\n\\(P_{\\text{base}}\\) is the base phyllochron (default: 120 °C·days), representing the typical interval between leaves under standard conditions for leaf rank from 3 to 7.\n\\(f_{\\text{leaf}}(n)\\) is a factor that adjusts the phyllochron depending on which leaf is appearing (\\(n\\) is the leaf cohort number).\n\\(f_{\\text{pp}}(d)\\) is a modifier that accounts for the effect of day length (\\(d\\) is the photoperiod in hours).\n\n\nLeaf Stage Factor\nThe rate at which new leaves appear changes as the plant grows. Early leaves appear faster, while later leaves take longer (Jamieson et al. 1998). This is represented by a piecewise function:\n\n\n\nLeaf Cohort Number (\\(n\\))\nFactor\n\n\n\n\n0–2\n0.75\n\n\n3–7\n1.0\n\n\n8+\n1.4\n\n\n\nThis means the first 2 leaves appear more quickly, leaves in the middle appear at a standard rate, and later leaves appear more slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaf Stage Factor as a Function of Leaf Cohort Number\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoperiod Effect\nThe model also accounts for how sensitive the plant is to day length with 6 degrees twilight. When days are short (less than 12 hours), leaf appearance slows down. The photoperiod effect is calculated as:\n\\[\nf_{\\text{pp}}(d) = 1 + S \\cdot f_d(d)\n\\]\n\n\\(S\\) is the photoperiod sensitivity (a parameter that can be adjusted for different varieties). \\(S\\) is typically set to 0.6 for wheat, which means the phyllochron increases by 60% (i.e. \\(120 \\times (1 + 0.6) = 192\\) °C·days) when day length is less than 8 hours, and not at all (i.e. \\(120 \\times (1 + 0) = 120\\) °C·days) when it is above 12 hours.\n\\(f_d(d)\\) describes how the effect changes with day length:\n\n\n\n\nDay Length (h)\nModifier \\(f_d(d)\\)\n\n\n\n\n8\n1.0\n\n\n12\n0.0\n\n\n20\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoperiod Effect on Phyllochron\n\n\n\n\nSo, for day lengths below 12 hours, the phyllochron increases (leaves appear more slowly), but above 12 hours, there is no further effect.",

When temperatures exceed a threshold, the response is either reduced or suppressed, mimicking de-vernalisation effects. This function plays a crucial role in modeling development timing for cold-requiring cultivars.\nIt implements the IFunction and IIndexedFunction interfaces, and is used within the context of the CAMP model for phase progression in phenology.",

Each phase corresponds to a physiological process or stage in the crop’s development (e.g., emergence, flowering, maturity). The transition between phases is typically governed by progression to completion. In general, the progression is influenced by factors such as thermal time, photoperiod, and vernalisation.\nThis model tracks the current phase, calculates progression based on progression to completion in current phase, and allows transitions to be triggered either naturally (via progression to completion) or manually (via SetToStage).

    "text": "In APSIM Next Gen, internal variables such as [Wheat].Phenology.FloweringDAS and [Wheat].Stem.N are accessible within the Report model. However, accessing these variables directly in a Manager Script requires a different approach.\nTo retrieve these values within a Manager Script, you can use the zone.Get() method to access the specific model. After obtaining the model, cast it to the appropriate type (e.g., IFunction, Plant, or IOrgan) to access its properties or methods. You can determine the model type by hovering over the model name in the APSIM user interface, which will display its full type name."

    "text": "Explanation\n\nAccessing [Wheat].Phenology.FloweringDAS\nThe [Wheat].Phenology.FloweringDAS variable is typically defined as a OnEventFunction function within the Phenology component of a Wheat model.\nTo access this function within a Manager script:\n\nRetrieve the Function: Use the zone.Get() method with the path to the function, e.g., \"[Wheat].Phenology.FloweringDAS\".\nCast to OnEventFunction: Cast the retrieved object to the OnEventFunction interface, which provides the Value() method to evaluate the function.\nEvaluate the Function: Call the Value() method to obtain the current value of FloweringDAS.\n\nThis approach allows dynamic access to model functions during simulation, enabling custom management decisions based on plant development stages.\n\n\nAccessing [Wheat].Stem.N\nThe nitrogen content (N) of the Stem organ is reportable variable. To access this variable:\n\nRetrieve the Plant Model: Use zone.Get(\"[Wheat].Stem\") to obtain the Stem model.\nCast to IOrgan: Cast the Stem organ to the GenericOrgan interface, which provides access to the N property.\nRetrieve Nitrogen Content: Access the N property to get the current nitrogen content of the Stem organ.\n\nThis method enables monitoring and managing nutrient dynamics within specific plant organs during simulation."
