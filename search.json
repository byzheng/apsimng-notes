However, accessing these variables directly in a Manager Script requires a different approach.\nTo retrieve these values within a Manager Script, you can use the zone.Get() method to access the specific model. After obtaining the model, cast it to the appropriate type (e.g., IFunction, Plant, or IOrgan) to access its properties or methods. You can determine the model type by hovering over the model name in the APSIM user interface, which will display its full type name."

    "text": "Explanation\n\nAccessing [Wheat].Phenology.FloweringDAS\nThe [Wheat].Phenology.FloweringDAS variable is typically defined as a OnEventFunction function within the Phenology component of a Wheat model.\nTo access this function within a Manager script:\n\nRetrieve the Function: Use the zone.Get() method with the path to the function, e.g., \"[Wheat].Phenology.FloweringDAS\".\nCast to OnEventFunction: Cast the retrieved object to the OnEventFunction interface, which provides the Value() method to evaluate the function.\nEvaluate the Function: Call the Value() method to obtain the current value of FloweringDAS.\n\nThis approach allows dynamic access to model functions during simulation, enabling custom management decisions based on plant development stages.\n\n\nAccessing [Wheat].Stem.N\nThe nitrogen content (N) of the Stem organ is reportable variable reporting. To access this variable:\n\nRetrieve the Plant Model: Use zone.Get(\"[Wheat].Stem\") to obtain the Stem model.\nCast to IOrgan: Cast the Stem organ to the GenericOrgan interface, which provides access to the N property.\nRetrieve Nitrogen Content: Access the N property to get the current nitrogen content of the Stem organ.\n\nThis method enables monitoring and managing nutrient dynamics within specific plant organs during simulation."
