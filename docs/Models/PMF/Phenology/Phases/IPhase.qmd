The `IPhase` interface defines the contract for a single developmental phase within the APSIM NG phenology module. It establishes the standard methods and properties that every phenological phase model must implement to enable modular, interchangeable phase components within the crop development system.

## Overview

In APSIM NG, crop development is organized into discrete phenological phases (e.g., Germination, Emergence, Flowering, Grain Filling). The `IPhase` interface provides a standardized framework that allows the Phenology model to manage these phases uniformly, regardless of their specific implementation details.

Each phase implementing this interface:

- Defines its **start** and **end** phenological stages (e.g., from "Sowing" to "Germinated")
- Calculates daily **progress** through the phase using environmental drivers (temperature, photoperiod, etc.)
- Reports its **completion status** as a fraction between 0 and 1
- Can be **reset** for new simulations or seasons
- Indicates whether it represents **above-ground** or **below-ground** development

The Phenology model orchestrates phases by calling `DoTimeStep()` each simulation day to advance development and checking `FractionComplete` to determine when to transition to the next phase.

**Configurable and Reportable Properties**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `Start` | string | Name of the phenological stage that marks the beginning of this phase (e.g., "Sowing", "Germinated"). |
| `End` | string | Name of the phenological stage that marks the completion of this phase (e.g., "Germinated", "Emergence"). |
| `IsEmerged` | bool | Boolean flag indicating whether the crop has emerged above the soil surface during this phase. Used by other models for processes like light interception. |

**Read-Only Reportable Properties**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `FractionComplete` | double | Fractional progress through the phase, where $0 \le F \le 1$. Returns 0 at phase start and 1 when the phase target is met. |
