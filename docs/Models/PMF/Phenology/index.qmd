Phenology is the component responsible for simulating developmental stages of a plantâ€”from emergence to flowering, grain filling, and maturity.


[Phenology](Phenology.qmd) is the main model to simulate the developmental progression of a plant through a series of defined growth stages based on progression to completion.

[Phases](Phases) are the individual growth stages that define the plant's lifecycle, such as emergence, flowering, and maturity. Each phase has specific characteristics and requirements for progression.

[CAMP](CAMP) is the Cereal Anthesis Molecular Phenology (CAMP) model which is based on the Kirby Framework, and assumes the timing of anthesis is a result of the timing of flag leaf and an additional thermal time passage from there to heading then anthesis.
