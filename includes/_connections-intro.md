This section describes how the model interacts with other components in the APSIM Next Generation framework.  
These connections allow the model to exchange information—such as environmental conditions, developmental stage, or physiological responses—with other parts of the simulation system. For a general overview of how model components are connected in APSIM, see the [Connections Overview](/docs/Models/Connections.qmd).
