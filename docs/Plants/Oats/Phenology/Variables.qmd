title: "Phenology Variables"
---

The oat phenology model outputs a range of variables that track developmental progress and can be reported or used by other models.

## Stage and Phase Variables

### CurrentStageName

**Type**: string

The name of the current phenological stage (e.g., "Emergence", "TerminalSpikelet", "Flowering", "HarvestRipe").

### CurrentPhaseName

**Type**: string

The name of the current phenological phase (e.g., "Germinating", "Vegetative", "GrainFilling").

### Stage

**Type**: double

A decimal stage number representing phenological development. This provides a continuous measure of development that increases monotonically through the crop's life cycle.

### FractionInCurrentPhase

**Type**: double (0-1)

The proportion of the current phase that has been completed, where 0 represents the start of the phase and 1 represents completion.

## Time Variables

### DaysAfterSowing

**Type**: double

Number of days since the crop was sown.

### ThermalTime

**Type**: double (°Cd)

Daily thermal time accumulation, calculated using sub-daily temperature interpolation.

## Vernalisation Variables

### Vrn1

**Type**: double (0-1)

The expression level of the Vrn1 gene, representing vernalisation accumulation. Values range from 0 (no vernalisation) to 1 (fully vernalised).

### Vrn4

**Type**: double (0 to VernLag)

The vernalisation conditioning accumulation. This tracks the lag phase before vernalisation responses become apparent.

### DailyVernalisation

**Type**: double

The daily increment in vernalisation, calculated as:

$$
\text{DailyVernalisation} = \Delta\text{HaunStage} \times \text{TempResponseProfile}
$$

## Photoperiod Variables

### Photoperiod

**Type**: double (hours)

Day length in hours, calculated from latitude, day of year, and twilight angle (6 degrees).

### PerceivedPhotoPeriod

**Type**: double (hours)

The photoperiod perceived by the plant. This is 0 before emergence (when the apex is below ground) and equals Photoperiod after emergence.

## Leaf Number Variables

### MinimumLeafNumber

**Type**: double

The base number of leaves produced under full vernalisation and long photoperiod (7 leaves for standard parameterisation).

### VernalLeaves

**Type**: double

Additional leaves produced due to vernalisation effects. This decreases as Vrn1 accumulates.

### PhotoLeaves

**Type**: double

Additional leaves produced due to short photoperiod effects. This decreases as day length increases.

### HaunStageTerminalSpikelet

**Type**: double

The target Haun Stage at which terminal spikelet forms, calculated as:

$$
\text{HSTS} = \text{MinimumLeafNumber} + \text{VernalLeaves} + \text{PhotoLeaves}
$$

## Sensitivity Parameters

### VrnSensitivity

**Type**: double (leaves)

The maximum number of additional leaves that can be produced in an unvernalised plant (0 for vernalisation-insensitive varieties).

### PpSensitivity

**Type**: double (leaves)

The reduction in leaf number when photoperiod increases from 8h to 16h (3 leaves for standard parameterisation).

### VernLag

**Type**: double

The amount of vernalisation required before vernalisation responses become evident (1.0 for standard parameterisation).

## Usage

These variables can be:

- Reported to output files for analysis
- Referenced by other models (e.g., Structure, Leaf, Grain)
- Used in Manager scripts for conditional logic
- Displayed in the user interface for monitoring crop development
