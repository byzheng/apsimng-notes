A data model that stores vernalisation rate parameters for a specific cultivar. These parameters are used within APSIM NG’s CAMP model to simulate the temperature and photoperiod sensitivity of flowering development in cereals such as wheat and barley.

## Overview

The `CultivarRateParams` class defines a set of vernalisation-related parameters tailored to a single genotype or cultivar. These values quantify the rates and thresholds for vernalisation gene expression (e.g., Vrn1, Vrn2, and Vrn3) under different photothermal conditions.

It is not a computational function itself but a container of parameters used by other modules like `CalcCAMPVrnRates` to describe how vernalisation proceeds under varying temperatures and daylengths. It supports detailed phenological simulations in APSIM NG’s [CAMP](CAMP.qmd) framework.

## Inputs

This model is not user-configurable directly through the UI and does not require inputs at runtime. Instead, it is populated by the `CalcCAMPVrnRates` function based on controlled environment FLN observations.

## Methodology

`CultivarRateParams` provides the following fields, which represent physiological and regulatory coefficients used to simulate flowering development:

- `BaseDVrnVeg` ($\Delta V_{\text{base, veg}}$): Baseline rate of vernalisation gene expression (Vrn1) in the vegetative phase at high temperatures (e.g., >20°C).
- `MaxDVrnVeg` ($\Delta V_{\text{max, veg}}$): Maximum upregulation of Vrn1 under cold conditions (e.g., 0°C).
- `BaseDVrnER` ($\Delta V_{\text{base, ER}}$): Baseline rate of Vrn1 expression during early reproductive phase without photoperiod upregulation.
- `MaxDVrnER` ($\Delta V_{\text{max, ER}}$): Maximum rate of Vrn1 expression during early reproductive phase under long photoperiod.
- `PpVrn3FactVeg` ($F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}}$): Enhancement factor for Vrn1 expression in vegetative phase due to Vrn3 upregulation under long days.
- `PpVrn3FactER` ($F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, ER}}$): Enhancement factor for Vrn1 expression in early reproductive phase due to Vrn3 under long days.
- `MaxVrn2` ($V_{\text{max, Vrn2}}$): Maximum Vrn2 expression level under long photoperiods, which must be suppressed before full Vrn1 expression can proceed.
- `MethalationThreshold` ($M_{\text{threshold}}$): Threshold level of cold-induced Vrn1 expression needed to enable persistent Vrn1 activation (methalation).
- `ColdVrn1Fact` ($C_{\text{Vrn1}}$): Factor by which cold temperatures increase the rate of Vrn1 expression compared to the baseline.

These parameters are essential for simulating genotype × environment interactions that influence time to floral initiation and flowering in cereal crops.
