title: "Thermal Time"

Thermal time (also called growing degree days) is the primary driver of phenological development in the oat model.

## Calculation Method

Daily thermal time is calculated using [SubDailyInterpolation](/docs/Models/Functions/SubDailyInterpolation.qmd) with [ThreeHourAirTemperature](/docs/Models/Functions/ThreeHourAirTemperature.qmd) interpolation method.

## Temperature Response

The thermal time response to temperature follows a three-cardinal-temperature model:

| Temperature (°C) | Thermal Time (°Cd) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 0                | 0                 |
| 30               | 30                |
| 40               | 0                 |

This creates a response curve where:

- **Below 0°C**: No thermal time accumulation (development ceases)
- **0-30°C**: Linear increase (1°C = 1°Cd)
- **30-40°C**: Linear decrease from 30 to 0
- **Above 40°C**: No thermal time accumulation (heat stress inhibits development)

## Sub-Daily Interpolation

Rather than using simple daily mean temperature, the model uses three-hourly air temperature interpolation to capture the effects of diurnal temperature variation. This is particularly important when temperatures cross critical thresholds (0°C or 40°C) during the day.

The three-hour interpolation provides more accurate thermal time estimates, especially under:

- Large diurnal temperature ranges
- Conditions where daily minimum or maximum temperatures exceed optimum thresholds
- Cool climates where temperatures frequently cross 0°C

## Usage

Thermal time is used by most phenological phases as the progression driver. It determines:

- Emergence timing (accumulated from germination)
- Leaf appearance rate (via phyllochron)
- Phase transitions (vegetative, reproductive, grain filling)
- Final grain fill duration
