The **Germinating** is a phenological phase in [Wheat](/docs/Plants/Wheat) used to represent the development period from **Sowing** to **Germination**. It determines whether the seed has germinated based on soil temperature and soil water.

## Overview

The [GerminatingPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GerminatingPhase.qmd) Model is used to simulate the germination of wheat seeds. This phase begins when Plant [Sowing](/docs/Models/Events.html#PlantSowing) occurs and ends when plant is germinated with conditions of soil temperature and soil water. See [GerminatingPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GerminatingPhase.qmd) for more details.

* The `Minimum Soil Temperature` is configured as zero by default, which means that the germination will not occur if the soil temperature is below zero,
* The `Soil Water Content` should be more than `Lower Limit` for germination to occur.


## Cultivar-Specific Parameters
