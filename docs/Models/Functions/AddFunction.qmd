The `AddFunction` is a utility function that returns the **sum of values** from all of its child functions.


## Overview

The `AddFunction` is used to sum up multiple values for a mathematical equation. It summarises values of all children functions and returns the total sum. This is useful when you need to combine multiple traits or parameters into a single value for further calculations in plant growth models. 



## Events 


**Events Listened For**

> No events are listened for by this function.


**Events Raised to**

> No events are raised by this function.


## Properties


**Configurable and Reportable Properties**

> No configurable properties are available for this function.

**Read-Only Reportable Properties**

> No read-only reportable properties are available for this function.


## User Interface

`AddFunction` can be added into the model tree by right-clicking on a parent node and selecting "Add Model...", and then search `Addfunction` in the Filter Box. A symbol for the `AddFunction` is displayed in the user interface to represent the function.

## Practical Example

The target thermal time from germination to emergence in the wheat model is determined by ShootLag ($ShootLag$), Sowing Depth ($SowingDepth$), and Shoot Rate ($ShootRate$).

$$
TT = ShootLag + (SowingDepth \times ShootRate)
$$

The `AddFunction` is used to sum these two values to get the total target thermal time in the equation above.
