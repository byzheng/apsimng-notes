The **Ripening** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **Maturity** to **HarvestRipe**. This phase covers the final drying period when seeds reach optimal moisture content for harvest.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **Maturity** and **HarvestRipe** stages.

- This phase starts at **Maturity** and ends at **HarvestRipe**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Ripening Process

During the ripening phase:

- Seeds continue to lose moisture
- Seed moisture content approaches harvest moisture (typically 12-15%)
- Plant is fully senesced and dry
- Pods are brown and brittle
- Seeds have hardened seed coats

## Harvest Readiness

Seeds are considered harvest ripe when:

- **Moisture content**: Typically 12-15% for safe storage
- **Physical handling**: Seeds resistant to mechanical damage during harvest
- **Pod shattering**: Pods dry but not yet prone to excessive shattering
- **Seed color**: Characteristic color for the cultivar is fully developed

## Cultivar-Specific Parameters

| Name       | Description                                         | Default Value |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| [Phenology].Ripening.Target   | Thermal time for ripening (°Cd) | Cultivar-specific |

## Environmental Factors

Ripening is influenced by:

1. **Temperature**: Higher temperatures accelerate drying
2. **Relative humidity**: Low humidity promotes faster moisture loss
3. **Rainfall**: Delays ripening and can reduce seed quality
4. **Wind**: Affects drying rate and pod shattering risk

## Practical Considerations

During the ripening phase:

- Monitor seed moisture content regularly
- Assess pod shattering risk if harvest is delayed
- Consider weather windows for harvest
- Prepare harvest equipment and storage facilities
- Assess crop uniformity and potential lodging issues
- Plan harvest sequence if managing multiple fields

Timely harvest at the appropriate ripening stage helps maximize grain yield, minimize shattering losses, and ensure good seed quality for storage or marketing.
