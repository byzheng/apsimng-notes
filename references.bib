  abstract = {Context Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) adaptation is highly dependent on crop lifecycle duration, particularly the time at which flowering occurs in a specific environment. Frost, low solar radiation, heat and drought can significantly reduce yield if a crop flowers too early or late. Wheat genotypes have different lifecycle durations determined by plant responses to temperature (thermal time accumulation and vernalisation) and photoperiod. These responses are largely controlled by five phenology genes (two PPD1 and three VRN1 genes). Advances in crop phenology modelling suggest that flowering time under field conditions could be accurately predicted with parameters derived from photoperiod and vernalisation responses obtained in controlled environments.Aims This study quantified photoperiod and vernalisation responses of 69 Australian wheat genotypes selected for diversity at the PPD1 and VRN1 loci.Methods Spring and winter genotypes were grown in four controlled environments at a constant temperature of 22°C with photoperiod (17 or 8h) and vernalisation (0 or 8weeks) treatments as factors.Key results Thermal time from coleoptile emergence to flowering in spring genotypes was typically decreased more by long photoperiod than by vernalisation; the opposite was true for winter genotypes. Spring genotypes that were sensitive to vernalisation contained a sensitive allele at the Vrn-A1 locus.Conclusions There is large diversity in phenological responses of wheat genotypes to photoperiod and vernalisation, including among those with matching multi-locus genotype.Implications Data from this study will be used to parameterise and test a wheat phenology model in a future study.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims A model to predict anthesis time of a wheat plant from environmental and genetic information requires integration of current concepts in physiological and molecular biology. This paper describes the structure of an integrated model and quantifies its response mechanisms. Methods Literature was reviewed to formulate the components of the model. Detailed re-analysis of physiological observations are utilized from a previous publication by the second two authors. In this approach measurements of leaf number and leaf and primordia appearance of near isogenic lines of spring and winter wheat grown for different durations in different temperature and photoperiod conditions are used to quantify mechanisms and parameters to predict time of anthesis. Key Results The model predicts the time of anthesis from the length of sequential phases: 1, embryo development; 2, dormant; 3, imbibed/emerging; 4, vegetative; 5, early reproductive; 6, pseudo-stem extension; and 7, ear development. Phase 4 ends with vernalization saturation (VS), Phase 5 with terminal spikelet (TS) and Phase 6 with flag leaf ligule appearance (FL). The durations of Phases 4 and 5 are linked to the expression of Vrn genes and are calculated in relation to change in Haun stage (HS) to account for the effects of temperature per se. Vrn1 must be expressed to sufficient levels for VS to occur. Vrn1 expression occurs at a base rate of 0·08/HS in winter ‘Batten’ and 0·17/HS in spring ‘Batten’ during Phases 1, 3 and 4. Low temperatures promote expression of Vrn1 and accelerate progress toward VS. Our hypothesis is that a repressor, Vrn4, must first be downregulated for this to occur. Rates of Vrn4 downregulation and Vrn1 upregulation have the same exponential response to temperature, but Vrn4 is quickly upregulated again at high temperatures, meaning short exposure to low temperature has no impact on the time of VS. VS occurs when Vrn1 reaches a relative expression of 0·76 and Vrn3 expression begins. However, Vrn2 represses Vrn3 expression so Vrn1 must be further upregulated to repress Vrn2 and enable Vrn3 expression. As a result, the target for Vrn1 to trigger VS was 0·76 in 8-h photoperiods (Pp) and increased at 0·026/HS under 16-h Pp as levels of Vrn2 increased. This provides a mechanism to model short-day vernalization. Vrn3 is expressed in Phase 5 (following VS), and apparent rates of Vrn3 expression increased from 0·15/HS at 8-h Pp to 0·33/HS at 16-h Pp. The final number of leaves is calculated as a function of the HS at which TS occurred (TSHS): 2·86 + 1·1 × TSHS. The duration of Phase 6 is then dependent on the number of leaves left to emerge and how quickly they emerge. Conclusions The analysis integrates molecular biology and crop physiology concepts into a model framework that links different developmental genes to quantitative predictions of wheat anthesis time in different field situations.},

  abstract = {The Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) is a software framework for creating models that represent the plant components of farm system models in the agricultural production system simulator (APSIM). It is the next step in the evolution of generic crop templates for APSIM, building on software and science lessons from past versions and capitalising on new software approaches. The PMF contains a top-level Plant class that provides an interface with the APSIM model environment and controls the other classes in the plant model. Other classes include mid-level Organ, Phenology, Structure and Arbitrator classes that represent specific elements or processes of the crop and sub-classes that the mid-level classes use to represent repeated data structures. It also contains low-level Function classes which represent generic mathematical, logical, procedural or reference code and provide values to the processes carried out by mid-level classes. A plant configuration file specifies which mid-level and Function classes are to be included and how they are to be arranged and parameterised to represent a particular crop model. The PMF has an integrated design environment to allow plant models to be created visually. The aims of the PMF are to maximise code reuse and allow flexibility in the structure of models. Four examples are included to demonstrate the flexibility of application of the PMF; 1. Slurp, a simple model of the water use of a static crop, 2. Oat, an annual grain crop model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 3. Lucerne, perennial forage model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 4. Wheat, another detailed annual crop model constructed using an alternative set of organ and process classes. These examples show the PMF can be used to develop models of different complexities and allows flexibility in the approach for implementing crop physiology concepts into model set up.},

  abstract = {The relative time to maturity of grain crops is an important consideration for producers, yet there are no universally accepted classification schemes for cultivar phenology to guide decisions on variety selection and time of sowing. A first edition of an industry guide for wheat variety maturity was recently developed for use across Australia, representing a significant step forward for the grains industry. The aim of this paper was to revise and extend this industry guide to make it more robust, agronomically functional and meaningful to industry. The Australian Cereal Phenology Classification (ACPC) presented herein was developed using an unprecedented phenological data set with a diverse array of genotypes, environments and management. Field experiments were carried out with 70 wheat and 30 barley cultivars at 15 sites across Australia between 2017 and 2020. Thermal time to anthesis data were used to rank cultivars according to their relative phenology and divide them into classes, and then boundary cultivars of both species were selected to separate these classes. The resulting classification scheme divides wheat and barley into phenology classes ranging from ‘quick’ to ‘mid’ to ‘slow’. New cultivars to market can be assigned a phenology classification based on their thermal time to anthesis relative to the boundary cultivars. The ACPC will help growers, agronomists, breeders and researchers make informed decisions regarding cultivar comparison and selection while reducing misclassification and confusion across regions. The same methodology used to derive and validate the ACPC can be applied internationally to standardise descriptions of crop phenology.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of plant development is essential for agronomic management and scientific research, and crop development scales with repeatable and reproducible protocols are required to achieve this. Development scales currently in use are ambiguous, subjective and qualitative, they do not describe all stages in a crop’s lifecycle, they do not explicitly distinguish between culm-level and crop-level development, and they are incompatible with modern analytical and computational technologies. Here we propose two new scales of wheat and barley development: the Single Culm Development Scale (SCDS) to define progression through the lifecycle of an individual culm, and the Population of Culms Development Scale (PCDS) to identify the timing of stages and duration of phases within a crop canopy. These development scales merge and fill gaps within existing scales currently in use, describe development in terms that are unambiguous, objective and quantitative, and better interface with crop simulation models, automated image analysis and other computational tools and analytical methods. The SCDS and PCDS are paired with definitive protocols to measure each stage that were developed and tested using different operators in controlled environment and field experiments.},

  abstract = {Eucalyptus-breeding efforts have been made to identify clones of superior performance for growth and yield and how they will interact with global climate changes. This study performs a global sensitivity analysis for assessing the impact of genetic traits on Eucalyptus yield across contrasting environments in Brazil under present and future climate scenarios. The APSIM Next Generation Eucalyptus model was used to perform the simulations of stemwood biomass (t ha−1) for 7-year rotations across 23 locations in Brazil. Projections for the period from 2020 to 2049 using three global circulation models under intermediate (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios were performed. The Morris sensitivity method was used to perform a global sensitivity analysis to identify the influence of plant traits on stemwood biomass. Traits for radiation use efficiency, leaf partitioning, canopy light capture and fine root partitioning were the most important, impacting the Eucalyptus yield substantially in all environments under the present climate. Some of the traits targeted now by breeders for current climate will remain important under future climates. However, breeding should place a greater emphasis on photosynthetic temperature response for Eucalyptus in some regions. Global sensitivity analysis was found to be a powerful tool for identifying suitable Eucalyptus traits for adaptation to climate variability and change. This approach can improve breeding strategies by better understanding the gene × environment interactions for forest productivity.},

For example, the development rate of a crop can be estimated quite well by making use of the average air temperature. After all, it is not possible to measure accurately the stages of development from day to day, which means that the effect of temperature must be integrated over at least a week. It is then usual to make use of the concept of ‘temperature sum’ or ‘degree-days’. This value is calculated as the integral of the value with which the (average) temperature exceeds a certain lower threshold (e.g. 5 °C), below which no development occurs at all. This procedure implicitly assumes a linear response above the lower threshold. Also the sum of radiation (possibly modified by the fraction intercepted, see Eqn 2.7) is often used.},

  abstract = {Sirius is a wheat simulation model that calculates biomass production from intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and grain growth from simple partitioning rules. Leaf area index (LAI) is developed from a thermal time sub-model. Phenological development is calculated from the mainstem leaf appearance rate and final leaf number, with the latter determined by responses to daylength and vernalisation. Effects of water and N deficits are calculated through their influences on LAI development and radiation-use efficiency. This paper describes the model and its validation using data from independent and near independent experiments at Lincoln, New Zealand, and Rothamsted, UK. Despite there being no calculation of tiller dynamics or grain number, the model accurately simulated the behaviour of crops exposed to a wide range of conditions. We conclude that the accurate prediction of phenological development and LAI is much more important for grain yield prediction than are the components of yield. Although grain population is not a necessary step in yield calculation in Sirius, the model proved useful in investigating the effects of stress in setting grain number. The analysis showed that the influence of stress on partitioning of biomass to the ear during pre-anthesis ear growth was much more important in determining grain number than was the effect on biomass accumulation during the same phase.},

Absolute and relative growth rates were estimated by regression and by fitting a modified logistic growth function, using thermal time as the independent variable. The number of living florets was counted in spikelet 10. The phyllochron was 101°Cd and 10 florets, at most, were initiated. Floret death started at about ear emergence and was complete in 90°Cd, just before anthesis when there were 4 surviving florets. Successive leaves and internodes grew at approximately 1 phyllochron interval and there were about 1.5 phyllochrons between the growth of leaf 9 and internode 8. The length-growth rate of the internodes increased from 1 mm (°Cd)−1 for internode 6 to 2 mm (°Cd)−1 for internode 9. The relative growth rate was about 0.02 (°Cd)−1 for both leaves and internodes, about twice that of the ear. Dry-mass growth was more complex than length growth and the logistic growth function was not satisfactory for some of the structures. The relation between floret death, stem length and dry-mass growth is consistent with the hypothesis that the death of florets is due to competition between the ear and the stem for resources at the time of the highest growth rate and when translocation may be affected by restriction of the vascular system.},

Cultivars of canola varying in maturity are grown over a wide range of photoperiod and temperature conditions in Australia. A quantitative understanding of the genotypic and environmental control of time to flowering can be used to improve breeding programs and crop management strategies. Controlled environment and field studies were used to determine the responses of 21 cultivars of canola and breeding lines of Indian mustard to vernalisation, temperature, and photoperiod. The number of days to flowering in all genotypes was reduced in response to vernalisation and long days, due to a reduced duration between sowing and buds visible. The vernalisation response was saturated with c. 25 days at 3°C. Base and optimum temperatures for development were confirmed at 0 and 20°C, respectively. The photoperiod response occurred between 10.8 and 16.3 h, and plants responded to photoperiod from emergence. A simulation model incorporating these effects was developed, which predicted days to flowering with a mean deviation of c. 5 days. Later flowering genotypes had model parameters that indicated greater responses to vernalisation and photoperiod than early-flowering genotypes.},

There has been no peer-reviewed account of the scientific underpinnings of the module, despite considerable testing across a wide range of environments in the Australian grains industry and numerous applications of the model to address agronomic and crop adaptation issues. This paper presents a summary of the parameters in the module and reviews the physiological evidence justifying their values and module performance, and reflects on areas of module improvement and application. APSIM-Canola simulates crop development, growth, yield and nitrogen (N) accumulation in response to temperature, photoperiod, radiation, soil water and N supply, with a daily time-step, using well-accepted approaches. The module has been validated on more than 250 data points across Australia, China, and Germany and typical root mean squared deviations for days to flowering are \textasciitilde 5 days and for grain yield are \textasciitilde 0.4~t~ha–1. Testing on vernalisation-responsive winter types and in high yielding situations has indicated that more research is required to define phenology parameters and yield forming processes in high yielding environments. There is a need to develop better predictive routines for grain oil content that take account of the dynamics of grain filling and interactions with environmental conditions, and improve upon current regression-type approaches. Further testing of N responses is required. Physiological characterisation of new cultivar types, such as hybrids, Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), and new herbicide tolerance types is required to make the module more applicable to contemporary canola production systems. A lack of understanding of the effects of high and low temperature extremes on reproductive processes is currently limiting the use of the module outside conventional sowing dates and agro-climatic zones.},

  abstract = {Heading time is a major determinant of the adaptation of wheat to different environments, and is critical in minimizing risks of frost, heat, and drought on reproductive development. Given that major developmental genes are known in wheat, a process-based model, APSIM, was modified to incorporate gene effects into estimation of heading time, while minimizing degradation in the predictive capability of the model. Model parameters describing environment responses were replaced with functions of the number of winter and photoperiod (PPD)-sensitive alleles at the three VRN1 loci and the Ppd-D1 locus, respectively. Two years of vernalization and PPD trials of 210 lines (spring wheats) at a single location were used to estimate the effects of the VRN1 and Ppd-D1 alleles, with validation against 190 trials (\textasciitilde 4400 observations) across the Australian wheatbelt. Compared with spring genotypes, winter genotypes for Vrn-A1 (i.e. with two winter alleles) had a delay of 76.8 degree days (°Cd) in time to heading, which was double the effect of the Vrn-B1 or Vrn-D1 winter genotypes. Of the three VRN1 loci, winter alleles at Vrn-B1 had the strongest interaction with PPD, delaying heading time by 99.0 °Cd under long days. The gene-based model had root mean square error of 3.2 and 4.3 d for calibration and validation datasets, respectively. Virtual genotypes were created to examine heading time in comparison with frost and heat events and showed that new longer-season varieties could be heading later (with potential increased yield) when sown early in season. This gene-based model allows breeders to consider how to target gene combinations to current and future production environments using parameters determined from a small set of phenotyping treatments.},
