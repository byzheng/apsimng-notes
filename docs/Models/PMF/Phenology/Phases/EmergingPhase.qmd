The `EmergingPhase` represents a phenological sub-phase within a plant's developmental timeline, responsible for simulating the transition from germination to emergence. It defines the conditions under which a seed emerges from the soil and completes the phase once those criteria are satisfied. Typically, it spans from the Germinated stage to the Emergence stage, and its completion is determined by either thermal time accumulation or a user-specified emergence date.

## Overview

The `EmergingPhase` models the transition from germination to emergence in the crop's phenological development. This phase simulates the time required for the shoot to grow from the seed depth to the soil surface, which is influenced by temperature and sowing depth.

Emergence occurs when any of the following conditions are met:

- Accumulated thermal time reaches the target value (specified by the `Target` child function),
- A specific **emergence date** is provided via the `DateToProgress` property.

The phase progresses using thermal time accumulation, typically calculated from the `Phenology.ThermalTime` function. Once the target is reached, the phase completes and triggers the transition to the next phenological stage.

**Events Listened For**

These are signals or notifications that the `EmergingPhase` listens for from other parts of the simulation:

## Processes and Algorithms

{{< include /includes/_processes-intro.md >}}


### Emergence Triggers

Emergence occurs in one of two ways:

1. **User-defined emergence date**  

   If `DateToProgress` is specified, emergence occurs exactly on that date, regardless of thermal time accumulation. This allows users to override the environmental-based calculation with observed or expected emergence dates.

2. **Thermal time accumulation**  

   If no date is defined, emergence is triggered when accumulated thermal time (`ProgressThroughPhase`) equals or exceeds the target value (`Target`). The target is set at sowing and represents the total thermal time required for the shoot to reach the soil surface from the sowing depth.


### Date Override

If `DateToProgress` is set to a specific date, the phase ignores thermal time accumulation and completes exactly on that date. This is useful for calibrating the model to match observed emergence dates or for scenarios where emergence timing is known.


### Thermal Time Accumulation

The `EmergingPhase` progresses based on thermal time accumulation. Each day, the phase calculates the thermal time for that day and adds it to the accumulated progress:

Let $TT_{\text{day}}$ be the thermal time for the current day (from `Phenology.ThermalTime`), $P$ be the accumulated progress through the phase (`ProgressThroughPhase`), and $T$ be the target thermal time (`Target`).

On each time step:

$$
P_{t+1} = P_t + TT_{\text{day}} \times f_{\text{day}}
$$

where $f_{\text{day}}$ is the proportion of the day to use (between 0 and 1), which accounts for phases that may complete mid-day.

### Phase Completion

The phase is considered complete when:

$$
P \geq T
$$

If the phase completes mid-day (i.e., $P_t + TT_{\text{day}} > T$), the unused portion of the day is calculated as:

$$
f_{\text{unused}} = \frac{P - T}{TT_{\text{day}}}
$$

This unused fraction is passed to the next phase, allowing it to begin progressing immediately.

## User Interface

EmergingPhase can be added as a child of a [Phenology](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phenology.qmd) node in the model tree. Right-click the Phenology node, select "Add Model...", and search for EmergingPhase in the Filter Box.

The phase requires a child function named `Target` to specify the thermal time requirement for emergence. This can be a constant value or a more complex function that accounts for sowing depth effects.
