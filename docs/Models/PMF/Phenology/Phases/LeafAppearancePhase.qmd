The `LeafAppearancePhase` represents a developmental phase in a plant's life cycle. The Final leaf number is fixed at the start of this phase. The remaining leaves continue to appear at a rate set by thermal time and phyllochron until flag leaf ligule appears and this phase is completed.

## Overview

The `LeafAppearancePhase` is a phenological stage within the APSIM Next Generation framework that models the interval from a specified start stage to an end stage. The Final leaf number is fixed at the start of this phase (e.g. terminal spikelet). The remaining leaves continue to appear at a rate set by thermal time and phyllochron until flag leaf ligule appears and this phase is completed.

## Inputs

The following input functions are required by `LeafAppearancePhase`:

- `FinalLeafNumber` — Total number of leaves the plant will develop.
- `LeafNumber` — The current number of leaves that have appeared on the plant.
- `FullyExpandedLeafNo` — The number of leaves that have fully expanded.
- `InitialisedLeafNumber` — The number of leaf primordia that have been initiated.

The following configuration parameters can be set:

- `Start` — Name of the phenological stage at which this phase begins.
- `End` — Name of the phenological stage at which this phase ends.
- `IsEmerged` — Boolean flag indicating whether this phase begins post-emergence. Default is `true`.

## Methodology

The `LeafAppearancePhase` calculates the fraction of the phase completed ($F$) using:

$$
F = \frac{LN_i - LN_0}{FLN - LN_0}
$$

Where:

- $LN_i$ is the current leaf number at day $i$,
- $LN_0$ is the leaf number at the start of the phase,
- $FLN$ is the final leaf number.


When all initialised leaf primordia have fully expanded, the phase is considered complete and moves to the next phase.
