The **ReadyForHarvesting** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the final phase after **HarvestRipe**. This is the end phase when the crop is fully mature and ready for harvest.

## Overview

The [EndPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/EndPhase.qmd) model simulates the final phase after **HarvestRipe**.

- This phase starts at **HarvestRipe** and represents the terminal stage of phenological development
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function, but it does not accumulate further thermal time
- This is an end phase that persists until the crop is harvested or removed

## Crop Status

Once the crop reaches ReadyForHarvesting:

- All phenological development is complete
- Seeds are at optimal moisture for harvest and storage
- The crop remains in this phase until harvest occurs
- Delayed harvest beyond this point provides no agronomic benefit

## Harvest Considerations

At this stage:

- **Immediate harvest**: Crop can be harvested any time conditions permit
- **Delay risks**: Prolonged delays increase risks of:
  - Pod shattering and seed loss
  - Weather damage (rain, wind, hail)
  - Quality degradation
  - Field accessibility issues
- **Quality maintenance**: Proper harvest and handling preserve seed quality

## Cultivar-Specific Parameters

> No cultivar-specific parameters are defined for this phase.

## Practical Considerations

When the crop reaches ReadyForHarvesting:

- Harvest as soon as field conditions and weather permit
- Ensure harvest equipment is properly adjusted for chickpea
- Minimize mechanical damage during harvest and handling
- Monitor seed moisture at harvest
- Avoid harvest during high humidity to prevent seed damage
- Plan for proper storage or immediate marketing

Prompt harvest at this stage helps maximize recoverable yield and seed quality while minimizing losses from shattering, weather damage, or quality deterioration.
