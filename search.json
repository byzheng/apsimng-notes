This approach ensures that nitrogen demand reflects both the developmental stage (timed by thermal accumulation) and the actual sink size (number of kernels), providing a biologically realistic and process-driven estimate of daily grain nitrogen requirements.\nA linear nitrogen filling rate is assumed, meaning that the demand increases uniformly from anthesis to the end of grain filling.

    "text": "Explanation\nThe Weather model in APSIM contains a CO2 property, which determines the atmospheric CO₂ concentration used in crop growth and development calculations. This property is normally updated with each day’s weather data.\nBy subscribing to the PreparingNewWeatherData event, the script intercepts the process before daily weather values are applied. This allows you to override the CO₂ value dynamically for the duration of the simulation.\nThis approach is particularly useful for experiments involving elevated CO₂ or simulating long-term climate change effects where static weather files are used but require changes in CO₂ independently."

    "text": "Potential bugs and Limitations\nThe current implementation assumes all organs have a defined minimum N concentration. The biomass is dropped if nitrogen uptake cannot meet the minimum concentration. This assumption is reasonable for photosynthesis, but may not be reasonable for reallocation and retranslocation. These unallocated biomass should return to original organs."
