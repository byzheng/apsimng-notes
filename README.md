# APSIM Next Generation Notes

Welcome to **APSIM Next Generation Notes** — my personal collection of notes, tips, tutorials, and code snippets for working with [APSIM Next Generation (APSIM NG)](https://www.apsim.info/apsim-next-generation/).

This repository serves as a knowledge base documenting my learning journey, experiments, and solutions to problems I've encountered while using APSIM NG. It includes:
