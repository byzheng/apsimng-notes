The APSIM Chickpea model is constructed using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) [@brown_plant_2014] by Brown, H.E., Huth, N.I. and Holzworth, D.P., which offers a modular library of plant organ and process submodels. This design allows for dynamic assembly of complex crop models, such as chickpea, by integrating components like photosynthesis and leaf development without additional coding.


## Phenology

The chickpea [phenology](Phenology/index.qmd) is simulated from sowing to harvest.
