    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nThe Weather model in APSIM contains a CO2 property, which determines the atmospheric CO₂ concentration used in crop growth and development calculations. This property is normally updated with each day’s weather data.\nBy subscribing to the PreparingNewWeatherData event, the script intercepts the process before daily weather values are applied. This allows you to override the CO₂ value dynamically for the duration of the simulation.\nThis approach is particularly useful for experiments involving elevated CO₂ or simulating long-term climate change effects where static weather files are used but require changes in CO₂ independently."

It acts like a biological clock, helping researchers and agronomists predict how fast a plant will grow new leaves under different conditions. This model is a key part of the crop’s phenology (developmental timing), which is crucial for understanding when the plant will reach important stages like flowering and grain filling.\nLeaf appearance rate is influenced by temperature (how warm it is), the plant’s stage of development (which leaf is appearing), and the length of the day (photoperiod). By adjusting these parameters, the model can represent different wheat varieties and growing environments. This helps breeders and agronomists select varieties that are better suited to specific climates or management practices.",

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nThe Phyllochron model is based on the idea that the time between new leaf appearances (measured in degree-days, or °C·days) is not constant. Instead, it changes depending on the leaf’s position on the plant and the day length.\nThe effective phyllochron (\\(P_{\\text{eff}}\\)) is calculated as:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{eff}} = P_{\\text{base}} \\times f_{\\text{leaf}}(n) \\times f_{\\text{pp}}(d)\n\\]\n\n\\(P_{\\text{base}}\\) is the base phyllochron (default: 120 °C·days), representing the typical interval between leaves under standard conditions for leaf rank from 3 to 7.\n\\(f_{\\text{leaf}}(n)\\) is a factor that adjusts the phyllochron depending on which leaf is appearing (\\(n\\) is the leaf cohort number).\n\\(f_{\\text{pp}}(d)\\) is a modifier that accounts for the effect of day length (\\(d\\) is the photoperiod in hours).\n\n\nLeaf Stage Factor\nThe rate at which new leaves appear changes as the plant grows. Early leaves appear faster, while later leaves take longer (Jamieson et al. 1998). This is represented by a piecewise function:\n\n\n\nLeaf Cohort Number (\\(n\\))\nFactor\n\n\n\n\n0–2\n0.75\n\n\n3–7\n1.0\n\n\n8+\n1.4\n\n\n\nThis means the first 2 leaves appear more quickly, leaves in the middle appear at a standard rate, and later leaves appear more slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaf Stage Factor as a Function of Leaf Cohort Number\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoperiod Effect\nThe model also accounts for how sensitive the plant is to day length with 6 degrees twilight. When days are short (less than 12 hours), leaf appearance slows down. The photoperiod effect is calculated as:\n\\[\nf_{\\text{pp}}(d) = 1 + S \\cdot f_d(d)\n\\]\n\n\\(S\\) is the photoperiod sensitivity (a parameter that can be adjusted for different varieties). \\(S\\) is typically set to 0.6 for wheat, which means the phyllochron increases by 60% (i.e. \\(120 \\times (1 + 0.6) = 192\\) °C·days) when day length is less than 8 hours, and not at all (i.e. \\(120 \\times (1 + 0) = 120\\) °C·days) when it is above 12 hours.\n\\(f_d(d)\\) describes how the effect changes with day length:\n\n\n\n\nDay Length (h)\nModifier \\(f_d(d)\\)\n\n\n\n\n8\n1.0\n\n\n12\n0.0\n\n\n20\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoperiod Effect on Phyllochron\n\n\n\n\nSo, for day lengths below 12 hours, the phyllochron increases (leaves appear more slowly), but above 12 hours, there is no further effect.",

This system provides a common language for describing crop development stages across different simulation platforms and field observations, enabling seamless integration between modeling and practical applications.\nThe BBCH system divides crop development into 10 principal growth stages (0-9), each subdivided into secondary stages, creating a numerical scale from 00 to 99. This model specifically handles cereal crops from germination through harvest, incorporating key developmental milestones such as emergence, leaf appearance, stem extension, flowering, and grain development.",

This calculation accounts for the “droopy leaf” method where visible leaf tips are one fewer than fully developed leaves.\n\n\nStem Extension and Node Development (BBCH 30-39)\nWhen the plant enters the LeafAppearance phase and appeared leaf cohort number is less than final leaf number, the BBCH transitions to stem extension stages:\n\\[\n\\text{BBCH} = 30 + \\min(9, N_{\\text{expanded}} - N_{\\text{initial}})\n\\]\nwhere \\(N_{\\text{expanded}}\\) is the current number of expanded leaf cohorts and \\(N_{\\text{initial}}\\) is the number of expanded cohorts at the start of stem extension. The model assumes node appearance occurs at the same rate as leaf appearance.\n\n\nInflorescence Development (BBCH 50-59)\nBBCH stage 50 occurs when the tassel becomes visible, which corresponds to the appearance of the flag leaf tip. During flag leaf expansion within the LeafAppearance phase after the final leaf has appeared:\n\\[\n\\text{BBCH} = 50 + 5 \\times \\frac{F_{\\text{current}} - F_{\\text{BBCH50}}}{1 - F_{\\text{BBCH50}}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(F_{\\text{current}}\\) is the current fraction through the LeafAppearance phase and \\(F_{\\text{BBCH50}}\\) is the fraction when BBCH 50 was reached. This assumes the tassel will be half emerged when the flag leaf is fully expanded.\n\n\nReproductive Development (BBCH 55-99)\nLater stages use linear interpolation between key phenological milestones:\nThe mapping between APSIM-NG stages and BBCH codes is:\n\n\n\nAPSIM Stage\nAPSIM Name\nBBCH Code\nBBCH Description\n\n\n\n\n6.0\nFlagLeafFullyExpanded\n55\nMid-tassel emergence\n\n\n7.0\nFlowering\n65\nMid-flowering\n\n\n8.0\nStartGrainFill\n70\nBeginning of grain development\n\n\n9.0\nEndGrainFill\n87\nPhysiological maturity\n\n\n10.0\nMaturity\n99\nHarvest product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: APSIM to Zadok Growth Stage Mapping",

    "text": "Overview\nThe IPhaseWithTarget interface is implemented by phenological phases that advance based on accumulating a measurable quantity (typically thermal time in degree days) until a target threshold is reached. This interface extends the basic IPhase contract by adding:\n\nA target value that defines when the phase is complete\nA progress tracker that accumulates the quantity through the phase\n\nCommon examples include:\n\nThermal time-based phases that accumulate degree days until emergence, flowering, or maturity\nDevelopment phases that track cumulative photoperiod or vernalization units\nGrowth stages that progress based on accumulated growing degree days\n\nBy standardizing these properties, the interface enables consistent implementation of target-driven phases and allows other models to query phase progress and completion criteria in a uniform way.",

This allows users to override the environmental-based calculation with observed or expected emergence dates.\nThermal time accumulation\nIf no date is defined, emergence is triggered when accumulated thermal time (ProgressThroughPhase) equals or exceeds the target value (Target). The target is set at sowing and represents the total thermal time required for the shoot to reach the soil surface from the sowing depth.\n\n\n\nDate Override\nIf DateToProgress is set to a specific date, the phase ignores thermal time accumulation and completes exactly on that date. This is useful for calibrating the model to match observed emergence dates or for scenarios where emergence timing is known.\n\n\nThermal Time Accumulation\nThe EmergingPhase progresses based on thermal time accumulation. Each day, the phase calculates the thermal time for that day and adds it to the accumulated progress:\nLet \\(TT_{\\text{day}}\\) be the thermal time for the current day (from Phenology.ThermalTime), \\(P\\) be the accumulated progress through the phase (ProgressThroughPhase), and \\(T\\) be the target thermal time (Target).\nOn each time step:\n\\[\nP_{t+1} = P_t + TT_{\\text{day}} \\times f_{\\text{day}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(f_{\\text{day}}\\) is the proportion of the day to use (between 0 and 1), which accounts for phases that may complete mid-day.\n\n\nPhase Completion\nThe phase is considered complete when:\n\\[\nP \\geq T\n\\]\nIf the phase completes mid-day (i.e., \\(P_t + TT_{\\text{day}} &gt; T\\)), the unused portion of the day is calculated as:\n\\[\nf_{\\text{unused}} = \\frac{P - T}{TT_{\\text{day}}}\n\\]\nThis unused fraction is passed to the next phase, allowing it to begin progressing immediately.",

It provides a standardized way to access critical developmental information about a plant’s growth stage, including the current phenological phase, numeric stage values, and emergence status. This interface ensures that different phenology implementations can be used interchangeably while maintaining consistent access to essential developmental data.\nPhenology models implementing this interface track plant development through discrete growth phases (such as emergence, vegetative growth, reproductive development, and maturity), allowing other plant components to respond appropriately to developmental changes. The interface supports both continuous stage numbers and the widely-used Zadok scale for crop development staging.",

The constrained growth for each organ is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nN_\\text{ConstrainedGrowth}[i] = \\frac{N_\\text{TotalAllocation}[i]}{\\text{Organs}[i]_\\text{MinNConc}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(N_\\text{TotalAllocation}[i]\\) is the total nitrogen allocated to organ \\(i\\)\n\\(\\text{Organs}[i]_\\text{MinNConc}\\) is the minimum nitrogen concentration required for organ \\(i\\)\n\nThis yields a per-organ limit on biomass, ensuring growth is feasible under nitrogen constraints. This is the most common case where nitrogen limits growth.\n\nScale Biomass Allocation Proportionally\n\nThe total biomass previously allocated (structural + metabolic + storage) is compared to ConstrainedGrowth[i].\nIf total allocation exceeds the constrained limit, all organs are scaled proportionally:\nLet:\nLet \\(DM_{total}[i]\\) be the total biomass allocated to organ \\(i\\):\n\\[\nDM_{total}[i] = DM_{structural}[i] + DM_{metabolic}[i] + DM_{storage}[i]\n\\]\nCalculate the proportion of each component:\n\\[\nP_{structural}[i] = \\frac{DM_{structural}[i]}{DM_{total}[i]}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{metabolic}[i] = \\frac{DM_{metabolic}[i]}{DM_{total}[i]}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{storage}[i] = \\frac{DM_{storage}[i]}{DM_{total}[i]}\n\\]\nScale each component by the N-constrained growth:\n\\[\nDM_{structural}[i] = \\min\\left(DM_{structural}[i], N_{constrained}[i] \\times P_{structural}[i]\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nDM_{metabolic}[i] = \\min\\left(DM_{metabolic}[i], N_{constrained}[i] \\times P_{metabolic}[i]\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nDM_{storage}[i] = \\min\\left(DM_{storage}[i], N_{constrained}[i] \\times P_{storage}[i]\\right)\n\\]\nThis ensures:\n\nNo component exceeds the N-limited capacity.\nRatios between structural, metabolic, and storage biomass are preserved.\n\n\nUpdate Final Biomass and Stress Report\n\nAfter applying constraints, updating the final biomass allocation and calculating the nutrient limitation is done as follows:\n\\[\nDM_\\text{Allocated} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( DM_{structural}[i] + DM_{metabolic}[i] + DM_{storage}[i] \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nDM_\\text{NutrientLimitation} = DM_\\text{PreNStressAllocation} - DM_\\text{Allocated}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(DM_\\text{Allocated}\\) is the total biomass realized after N constraints.\n\\(DM_\\text{PreNStressAllocation}\\) is the total biomass allocated before applying N constraints.\n\\(DM_\\text{NutrientLimitation}\\) is the biomass lost due to insufficient nitrogen.",

In agricultural systems, using only daily maximum and minimum values to represent diurnal patterns can introduce significant errors, particularly for non-linear responses such as thermal time accumulation near temperature thresholds.\nThis function operates in three sequential steps:\n\nInterpolation: A child InterpolationMethod generates sub-daily values from daily minimum and maximum inputs (e.g., from weather data).\nResponse Transformation: Each interpolated value is passed through a child Response function, which can apply non-linear transformations such as temperature response curves with base and optimal thresholds.\nAggregation: The transformed sub-daily values are either averaged or summed to produce the final daily value, depending on the specified aggregation method.\n\nSubDailyInterpolation is particularly critical for thermal time calculations, where temperature effects on crop development are highly non-linear. Using sub-daily temperature resolution prevents underestimation or overestimation that occurs when applying response functions to daily mean temperatures.",

    "text": "Processes and Algorithms\n\nThis section describes the scientific processes and algorithms represented by this component. Each process corresponds to a biological, physical, or chemical mechanism simulated during a model time step. Where appropriate, equations or conceptual summaries are provided to explain how the process operates within the APSIM Next Generation framework.\n\n\nSub-Daily Interpolation and Aggregation\nAt the start of each simulation day (triggered by the DoDailyInitialisation event), SubDailyInterpolation performs the following sequence:\n\n1. Interpolation\nThe child InterpolationMethod (e.g., ThreeHourAirTemperature) generates a series of sub-daily values from the daily minimum and maximum inputs:\n\\[\nT_{i} = f_{\\text{interpolate}}(T_{\\min}, T_{\\max}, t_i)\n\\]\nwhere: - \\(T_i\\) = interpolated value at sub-daily time step \\(i\\) - \\(T_{\\min}\\) = daily minimum value (from weather data) - \\(T_{\\max}\\) = daily maximum value (from weather data) - \\(t_i\\) = time of day for sub-daily step \\(i\\) - \\(f_{\\text{interpolate}}\\) = interpolation function (e.g., sinusoidal curve fitting diurnal temperature pattern)\nFor ThreeHourAirTemperature, this produces 8 values at 3-hour intervals (0:00, 3:00, 6:00, …, 21:00).\n\n\n2. Response Transformation\nEach interpolated value is passed through the child Response function, which applies a transformation (typically a temperature response curve):\n\\[\nR_i = f_{\\text{response}}(T_i)\n\\]\nwhere: - \\(R_i\\) = response value at sub-daily time step \\(i\\) - \\(f_{\\text{response}}\\) = response function (e.g., XYPairs defining piecewise linear or non-linear response)\nFor thermal time calculations, the response function typically implements a piecewise curve:\n\\[\nf_{\\text{response}}(T) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } T &lt; T_{\\text{base}} \\\\\nT - T_{\\text{base}} & \\text{if } T_{\\text{base}} \\le T \\le T_{\\text{opt}} \\\\\nT_{\\text{opt}} - T_{\\text{base}} - \\frac{(T - T_{\\text{opt}})(T_{\\text{opt}} - T_{\\text{base}})}{T_{\\text{max}} - T_{\\text{opt}}} & \\text{if } T_{\\text{opt}} &lt; T \\le T_{\\text{max}} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } T &gt; T_{\\text{max}}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(T_{\\text{base}}\\), \\(T_{\\text{opt}}\\), and \\(T_{\\text{max}}\\) are cardinal temperatures defining the crop’s temperature response.\n\n\n3. Aggregation\nThe transformed sub-daily values are aggregated according to the specified agregationMethod:\nAverage Method (typical for thermal time): \\[\nV_{\\text{daily}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i\n\\]\nSum Method (used when accumulating total effects): \\[\nV_{\\text{daily}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i\n\\]\nwhere: - \\(V_{\\text{daily}}\\) = final daily aggregated value - \\(n\\) = number of sub-daily time steps - \\(R_i\\) = response value at time step \\(i\\)\n\n\n\nBiological Significance\nThe sub-daily approach is essential for accurate thermal time calculation because:\n\nNon-linear Response: Temperature effects on development are non-linear with distinct base, optimum, and maximum thresholds. Applying these thresholds to daily mean temperature produces different results than averaging the responses to sub-daily temperatures.\nThreshold Effects: When daily mean temperature falls within the optimal range but sub-daily temperatures exceed or fall below cardinal thresholds, using only the mean temperature misses important inhibitory effects.\nDiurnal Asymmetry: The timing and duration of exposure to different temperature ranges during the day affects developmental responses. Sub-daily resolution captures these temporal patterns.\nAccuracy at Temperature Extremes: When daily temperature ranges span multiple thermal response zones (base to optimal to supra-optimal), sub-daily interpolation provides substantially more accurate thermal time estimates than using daily averages.\n\nFor example, with a daily minimum of 5°C and maximum of 35°C (mean 20°C), and cardinal temperatures of base=0°C, optimum=30°C, maximum=40°C, applying the response to the mean temperature produces a different thermal time value than averaging the responses to the actual diurnal temperature curve.",

    "text": "Overview\nThe FrostHeatDamageFunctions function is developed to account for the effects of frost and heat stresses on yield reduction, which runs at the daily step separating with yield estimation. The damage function is the product of the potential yield reduction induced by extreme(i.e.frost and heat) events and the sensitivity of the yield reduction to the growth stage when the events occur.The potential ratio of yield reduction induced by a frost or heat event is a piece-wise linear function of daily minimum or maximum air temperature, respectively.The potential ratio of yield reduction ranges from 0 to 1 indicating mild to severe yield reduction induced by an extreme event. The function is described with three parameters including the lower and upper temperature thresholds and the maximum yield reduction. The sensitivity of yield reduction to the growth stage is a piece-wise linear function of the growth stage simulated by APSIM. The sensitivity ranges from 0 to 1 indicating the least to most sensitivity of yield reduction.The function has four parameters: the lower and upper growth stage thresholds of the sensitive period to frost or heat stress, and the lower and upper growth stage thresholds of the most sensitive period around flowering when sensitivity equals 1. The same function of sensitivity applies to both frost and heat stress but with different parameterizations. Multiple frost and heat events during the sensitive period have multiplicative effects on yield reduction rather than additive effects.",

    "text": "Practical Example\nConsider a wheat crop experiencing two frost events during the critical anthesis period:\n\nDay 1 (Anthesis): Growth stage = 8.0, minimum temperature = -1°C\nDay 2 (Post-anthesis): Growth stage = 8.2, minimum temperature = -2°C\n\nUsing the default wheat parameters from the table above, we can calculate the frost damage step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate Potential Reduction Ratios\nFor each day, we calculate the potential reduction using the frost temperature response function:\nDay 1 (T_min = -1°C): - Since -1°C is between FrostLowTT (-4°C) and FrostUpTT (1°C), we use linear interpolation: - \\(P_{frost}(-1) = 0.40 + (-1 - (-4)) \\times \\frac{(0.00 - 0.40)}{(1 - (-4))} = 0.40 + 3 \\times \\frac{-0.40}{5} = 0.40 - 0.24 = 0.16\\)\nDay 2 (T_min = -2°C): - \\(P_{frost}(-2) = 0.40 + (-2 - (-4)) \\times \\frac{(0.00 - 0.40)}{(1 - (-4))} = 0.40 + 2 \\times \\frac{-0.40}{5} = 0.40 - 0.16 = 0.24\\)\n\n\nStep 2: Calculate Growth Stage Sensitivity\nFor both days, we calculate sensitivity using the frost sensitivity function:\nDay 1 (GS = 8.0): - GS 8.0 is between FrostStartMostSensitiveGS (8.0) and FrostEndMostSensitiveGS (9.5) - Therefore: \\(S_{frost}(8.0) = 1.0\\) (maximum sensitivity)\nDay 2 (GS = 8.2): - GS 8.2 is also between 8.0 and 9.5 - Therefore: \\(S_{frost}(8.2) = 1.0\\) (maximum sensitivity)\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate Daily Frost Reduction Ratios\nDay 1: \\(R_{frost}(1) = P_{frost}(-1) \\times S_{frost}(8.0) = 0.16 \\times 1.0 = 0.16\\) (16% yield loss)\nDay 2: \\(R_{frost}(2) = P_{frost}(-2) \\times S_{frost}(8.2) = 0.24 \\times 1.0 = 0.24\\) (24% yield loss)\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate Cumulative Frost Damage\nThe cumulative frost reduction after both events is:\n\\[R_{frost,\\ cum}(2) = 1 - \\prod_{i=1}^{2} (1 - R_{frost}(i))\\]\n\\[R_{frost,\\ cum}(2) = 1 - [(1 - 0.16) \\times (1 - 0.24)]\\]\n\\[R_{frost,\\ cum}(2) = 1 - [0.84 \\times 0.76] = 1 - 0.6384 = 0.3616\\]\n\n\nStep 5: Calculate Final Yield Impact\nIf the potential wheat yield was 5000 kg/ha (500 g/m²), the frost-limited yield would be:\n\\[Y_{frost} = Y \\times (1 - R_{frost,\\ cum}) = 500 \\times (1 - 0.3616) = 500 \\times 0.6384 = 319.2 \\text{ g/m²}\\]\nResult: The two frost events result in a cumulative yield loss of 36.2%, reducing the potential yield from 5000 kg/ha to 3192 kg/ha.\nThis example demonstrates how:\n\nMultiple frost events have multiplicative (not additive) effects\nThe timing during the sensitive period (anthesis) maximizes damage\nColder temperatures cause proportionally more damage\nThe cumulative effect (36.2%) is less than the sum of individual events (16% + 24% = 40%)",

This interface abstracts the complexity of the model tree structure, offering intuitive methods for finding child models, parent models, siblings, and models in scope. It also provides powerful locator functionality for accessing model properties and variables using path-based notation, similar to file system navigation.\nModels receive an IStructure instance through dependency injection (via IStructureDependency), which grants them the ability to dynamically discover and interact with other components without hard-coded dependencies. This design enables flexible model composition, where complex behaviors emerge from simple, loosely-coupled components working together through the structure system.\nThe interface supports both direct tree navigation (parent-child-sibling relationships) and scope-based discovery (finding models according to APSIM-NG’s scoping rules), making it suitable for both simple component access and complex cross-model interactions.",

The calculation divides the 24-hour day into four periods based on sunrise and sunset:\n\nPeriod A: Midnight to Sunrise (Th &lt; Hsrise)\n\nTemperature is modeled as an exponential decline from the temperature at the previous day’s sunset (\\(Tsset\\)) down to the minimum temperature (Tmin) at sunrise. The hour of sunrise is denoted as \\(H_{srise}\\), and sunset as \\(H_{sset}\\). The temperature \\(T_a\\) at hour \\(Th\\) in this period is given by:\n\\[\nT_a = \\frac{T_{min} - T_{sset} \\cdot e^{-\\frac{n}{TC}} + (T_{sset} - T_{min}) \\cdot e^{-\\frac{(Th + 24 - H_{sset})}{TC}}}{1 - e^{-\\frac{n}{TC}}}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nT_{sset} = T_{min} + (T_{maxB} - T_{min}) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi d}{d + 2P}\\right)\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nn = 24 - d\n\\]\nHere, \\(T_{maxB}\\) is the previous day’s maximum temperature, \\(P\\) and \\(TC\\) are constants (1.5 and 4.0 respectively).\n\nPeriod B: Sunrise to Tmax ( \\(H_{srise} \\leq Th &lt; 12 + P\\) )\n\nDuring sunlight hours, the temperature follows a sinusoidal curve rising from \\(T_{min}\\) at sunrise to \\(T_{max}\\) at hour \\(12 + P\\):\n\\[\nT_a = T_{min} + (T_{max} - T_{min}) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi (Th - H_{srise})}{d + 2P}\\right)\n\\]\n\nPeriod C: Tmax to Sunset ( \\(12 + P \\leq Th &lt; H_{sset}\\) )\n\nThe temperature follows a sinusoidal decline from \\(T_{max}\\) to the next day’s minimum temperature \\(T_{minA}\\):\n\\[\nT_a = T_{minA} + (T_{max} - T_{minA}) \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi (Th - H_{srise})}{d + 2P}\\right)\n\\]\n\nPeriod D: Sunset to Midnight ( \\(Th \\geq H_{sset}\\) )\n\nAfter sunset, temperature exponentially declines from the temperature at sunset \\(T_{sset}\\) to the minimum temperature at sunrise.

    "text": "Overview\nThe CAMP models vernalisation gene expression in wheat and other temperate cereals. It simulates molecular responses to temperature and photoperiod signals that regulate flowering transitions, including upregulation of Vrn1, Vrn2, and Vrn3 (Brown et al. 2013). These genes regulate the timing of key developmental transitions, particularly the completion of vernalisation and initiation of the reproductive phase.\nProgress through the vernalising phase is determined by the apparent expression of Vrn1 and Vrn2 genes. Vrn1 is the gene that orchestrates cold temperature responses in development. To complete the vernalising stage, Vrn1 expression must first reach a threshold of at least 1.0. In warm temperatures (above 18 °C), Vrn1 is expressed at a genotype-dependent base rate. This base rate is lower for vernalisation-sensitive genotypes, which develop slower under warm conditions. However, exposure to cold temperatures accelerates Vrn1 expression, causing vernalisation-sensitive varieties to reach this stage at a lower Haun stage.\nVrn2 is upregulated by longer photoperiods and acts as a repressor of Vrn3, which is essential for progression to spikelet initiation. Vrn1 in turn represses Vrn2. Thus, higher photoperiod-induced Vrn2 expression raises the Vrn1 target above 1.0, extending the vernalisation phase. Conversely, shorter days reduce the Vrn1 target, a phenomenon known as short-day vernalisation. Vrn3 may also contribute to the acceleration of Vrn1 expression during vernalisation, a process represented by a composite parameter VrnX in the CAMP model.\nThe CAMP model integrates molecular and physiological representations to better capture genotype × environment × management (G×E×M) interactions and to provide a mechanistic bridge between genetic parameters and field-level crop behavior. All gene expressions are derived daily based on haun stage increment, temperature, and photoperiod.\nThree groups of genes are involved in cereal phenology:\n\nVernalisation genes (VRN): These genes promote flowering in response to prolonged exposure to cold temperatures.\nPhotoperiod sensitivity genes (PPD): These genes regulate flowering time based on day length.\nEarliness per se genes (EPS): These genes control the rate of development independently of environmental cues.\n\nFour treatments are used to represent the major gene effects on phenology (Bloomfield et al. 2023; Zheng et al. 2013) including\n\n\n\nTreatment\nDescription\nVRN\nPPD\nEPS\n\n\n\n\nLV\nLong photoperiod with vernalisation\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n\nLN\nLong photoperiod without vernalisation\n✗\n✓\n✓\n\n\nSV\nShort photoperiod with vernalisation\n✓\n✗\n✓\n\n\nSN\nShort photoperiod without vernalisation\n✗\n✗\n✓\n\n\n\nVernalisation genes are activated by exposure to low temperatures following seed germination.",

The rate of gene expression is genotype-specific and internally derived from FLN parameters.\n\nVrn1 is expressed at a base rate under warm conditions, increasing under colder temperatures. The total expression includes both base and cold-driven components. Once Vrn1 expression exceeds the threshold of 1.0, the plant is considered vernalised.\nVrn2 is upregulated by long photoperiods. It inhibits Vrn3 expression and must be repressed (via increased Vrn1) before reproductive development can proceed.\nVrn3 is upregulated after vernalisation is complete and is necessary for terminal spikelet initiation. Its expression accelerates phenological progression.\nVrnX captures the net effect of photoperiod (via Vrn2 and Vrn3) on vernalisation duration.\n\nThe following steps are performed on event PrePhenology:\n\nCalculate daily Haun Stage changes\nWhether the crop has emerged is determined by whether the current phase represents development above the soil surface — that is, the phase itself occurs above ground or comes after emergence in most plants.\nIf the crop has not emerged, the Haun Stage delta (\\(\\Delta HS\\)) is estimated based on daily thermal time (\\(TT\\)) and a base phyllochron:\n\\[\n\\Delta HS = \\frac{TT}{Ph_\\text{base}} \\times F_{\\text{emgDur}}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(Ph_\\text{base}\\) is the base phyllochron (thermal time per leaf appearance) for the crop, is a factor that slows down leaf appearance\n\\(F_{\\text{emgDur}}\\) is a factor that accounts for the duration of emergence, which is set to 1.0 if the accumulated thermal time since sowing does not exceed 90°C·d.\n\nIf the accumulated thermal time since sowing exceeds 90°C·d, a correction factor is applied to account for prolonged or delayed emergence conditions:\n\\[\nF_{\\text{emgDur}} = e^{-0.015 \\times ( \\sum_{t = t_{\\text{sow}}}^{t_{\\text{today}}} TT_t - 90)}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\sum_{t = \\text{sow}}^{\\text{today}} TT_t\\) is the cumulative thermal time from sowing to today.\n\nIf the crop has emerged, \\(\\Delta HS\\) is calculated from the model input variable deltaHaunStage. In general, this variable is updated daily based on the daily thermal time and actual phyllochron.\n\n\nBase and Maximum Vernalisation Expression\nGene expression is divided into:\n\n\\(Vrn_{\\text{base}}\\): Baseline vernalisation expression, which is the cumulative amount of Vrn1 expressed under baseline conditions,\n\\(Vrn_{\\text{max}}\\): Maximum vernalisation expression, which is the cumulative amount of Vrn1 expressed under maximum conditions (e.g. cold temperatures),\n\\(F_{\\text{Pp, Vrn3}}\\): Photoperiod factor for Vrn3 expression, which is the factor that modifies Vrn3 expression based on photoperiod\nIf not yet vernalised, e.g. from sowing to vernalisation saturation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta Vrn_{\\text{base}} = \\Delta Vrn_{\\text{base, veg}} \\times \\Delta HS\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\Delta Vrn_{\\text{base, veg}}\\) is the baseline rate of Vrn1 expression during the vegetative phase, which is derived from the calcCAMPVrnRates submodule at event PlantSowing,\n\\(\\Delta HS\\) is the daily Haun stage increment.\n\n\\[\n\\Delta Vrn_{\\text{max}} = \\Delta Vrn_{\\text{max, veg}} \\times \\Delta HS\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\Delta Vrn_{\\text{max, veg}}\\) is the maximum rate of Vrn1 expression during the vegetative phase, also derived from the calcCAMPVrnRates submodule at event PlantSowing,\n\\(\\Delta HS\\) is the daily Haun stage increment.\n\n\\[\nF_{\\text{Pp, Vrn3}} = F_{\\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(F_{\\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}}\\) is the photoperiod factor for Vrn3 expression during the vegetative phase, derived from the calcCAMPVrnRates submodule at event PlantSowing.\nIf vernalised but not reproductive, e.g. from vernalisation saturation to floral initiation:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta Vrn_{\\text{base}} = \\Delta Vrn_{\\text{base, ER}} \\times \\Delta HS\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\Delta Vrn_{\\text{base, ER}}\\) is the baseline rate of Vrn1 expression during the early reproductive phase, derived from the calcCAMPVrnRates submodule at event PlantSowing,\n\\(\\Delta HS\\) is the daily Haun stage increment.\n\n\\[\n\\Delta Vrn_{\\text{max}} = \\Delta Vrn_{\\text{max, ER}} \\times \\Delta HS\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\Delta Vrn_{\\text{max, ER}}\\) is the maximum rate of Vrn1 expression during the early reproductive phase, derived from the calcCAMPVrnRates submodule at event PlantSowing,\n\\(\\Delta HS\\) is the daily Haun stage increment.\n\n\\[\nF_{\\text{Pp, Vrn3}} = F_{\\text{Pp, Vrn3, ER}}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(F_{\\text{Pp, Vrn3, ER}}\\) is the photoperiod factor for Vrn3 expression during the early reproductive phase, derived from the calcCAMPVrnRates submodule at event PlantSowing.\n\n\\(Vrn_{\\text{base}}\\) and \\(Vrn _{\\text{max}}\\) are accumulated since isImbibed is true, in general starting from germination.\n\\[\nVrn_{\\text{base}} = \\sum_{t = \\text{imbibed}}^{\\text{today}} \\Delta Vrn_{\\text{base}}\n\\]\n\\[\nVrn_{\\text{max}} = \\sum_{t = \\text{imbibed}}^{\\text{today}} \\Delta Vrn_{\\text{max}}\n\\]\n\n\nCold Vernalisation (Vrn1)\nCold response affects Vrn1 expression:\n\\[\n\\Delta Cold = R_{\\text{cold,\\ vrn}} \\times \\Delta Vrn_{\\text{base}} \\times F_{\\text{cold, vrn1}}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(R_{\\text{cold,\\ vrn}}\\) is the cold upregulation response for Vrn1 expression, specified by the input child function ColdVrnResponse,\n\\(F_{\\text{cold, vrn1}}\\) is the cold upregulation factor for Vrn1 expression, derived from the calcCAMPVrnRates submodule at event PlantSowing.\n\nThen the total Cold exposure is accumulated since imbibition (i.g. germination):\n\\[\nCold = \\sum_{t = \\text{imbibed}}^{\\text{today}} \\Delta Cold\n\\]\nIf cold exposure surpasses a methylation threshold \\(\\theta_{\\text{meth}}\\), which is derived from the calcCAMPVrnRates submodule at event PlantSowing.

    "text": "Docs Models PMF Phenology CAMP CAMP\n\nCereal Anthesis Molecular Phenology (CAMP) model (Brown et al. 2013) is based on the Kirby (1988)’s Framework which assumes the timing of anthesis is a result of the timing of flag leaf and an additional thermal time passage from there to heading then anthesis. It also assumes the timing of flag leaf is a result of the Final Leaf Number (which sets a target) and leaf appearance rate (which sets the rate of progress toward the target). Leaf appearance rate is a function of Thermal time and a cultivar specific Phyllochron which changes with Haun stage as described by (Jamieson et al. 1998).\nMaster model, CAMP, is the main entry point for the Cereal Anthesis Molecular Phenology model in APSIM NG.

Each phase represents a physiological developmental period (e.g., germination, emergence, vegetative growth, flowering, grain filling, maturity). The model tracks developmental progress through phases, triggers stage-specific events, and maintains accumulated thermal time from sowing and emergence.\n\nA phase is a period of development with specific environmental responses (e.g., “Vegetative” phase may respond to photoperiod)\nA stage is a discrete developmental milestone that marks transitions between phases (e.g., “Emergence”, “Flowering”)\n\nPhase transitions are driven by environmental factors including:\n\nThermal time (accumulated temperature above base threshold)\nPhotoperiod (daylength sensitivity for certain phases)\nVernalization (cold temperature requirement for certain crops)\nSpecific dates (calendar-based completion for management scenarios)\n\nThe Phenology model acts as the master clock for plant development, coordinating timing signals with other components such as leaf expansion, stem elongation, grain development, and senescence processes. This temporal coordination ensures that developmental events occur in biologically realistic sequences and at appropriate rates given environmental conditions.",

If thermal time is negative, an error is raised as this indicates an issue with the ThermalTime function configuration.\n\n\nStep 2: Progress Through Current Phase\nThe current phase’s DoTimeStep method is called, which:\n\nCalculates phase-specific developmental progress based on environmental conditions\nReturns true if the phase is complete and should transition to the next phase\nProvides a proportion of the day to use for thermal time accumulation\n\n\n\nStep 3: Handle Phase Transitions\nWhen a phase completes:\n\nThe completed stage name is added to the list of stages passed today\nThe phase index increments to move to the next phase (unless already incremented by a GotoPhase)\nIf the plant has just emerged, the PlantEmerged event is raised\nThe PhaseChanged event is raised with the new stage name\nIf the new phase is a GotoPhase, it immediately executes its stage-setting logic\nThe new phase’s DoTimeStep is called to check if it also completes on the same day\n\nThis process repeats until a phase does not complete within the same timestep.\n\n\nStep 4: Update Accumulated Thermal Time\nUnless the stage was manually set via SetToStage today:\n\nTotal accumulated thermal time increases by today’s thermal time value\nIf the plant has emerged, emerged thermal time also increases\n\n\n\nStep 5: Raise Post-Phenology Event\nAfter all phenological calculations are complete, the PostPhenology event is raised, allowing other components to respond to the updated developmental state.\n\n\n\nStage Manipulation\n\nSetToStage Method\nThe SetToStage method allows manual control of phenological development, either moving forward or backward through stages. This is used for management actions (harvest, cutting) or special phase logic (GotoPhase).\nThe method accepts either a stage name (string) or stage number (double) and performs different operations depending on direction:\nRewinding (Moving to Earlier Stage):\nWhen setting to an earlier stage:\n\nIdentifies all phases between the current and target stages\nValidates that each phase can be rewound (only specific phase types support rewinding)\nFor each phase being rewound:\n\nSubtracts the phase’s accumulated thermal time from total and emerged thermal time\nCalls the phase’s ResetPhase method to clear internal state\n\nEnsures accumulated thermal time values remain non-negative\n\nFast-Forwarding (Moving to Later Stage):\nWhen setting to a later stage:\n\nIdentifies all phases between current and target stages\nFor each phase to skip:\n\nAdds the stage name to stages passed today\nIf the phase has a target, adds the remaining thermal time to reach the target\nRaises PlantEmerged event if crossing emergence\nRaises PhaseChanged event for each stage transition\n\nSets the target phase’s progress to the appropriate fraction\n\nFractional Stage Setting:\nWhen setting to a fractional stage (e.g., 3.5), the model:\n\nMoves to the phase corresponding to the integer part (phase 3)\nSets progress within that phase to the fractional part (50% through phase 3)\n\nThe StageWasReset event is raised at the conclusion to signal that a manual stage change occurred.\n\n\n\nPhase Completion by Date\nFor phases that implement IPhaseWithSetableCompletionDate, the model can force completion on a specific calendar date rather than using the phase’s normal progression mechanism. This is managed through:\n\nSetPhaseCompletionDate(completionDate, phaseName): Sets the target date for a named phase\nFractionComplete(): Calculates fractional progress based on days elapsed vs total days to completion date\ncheckIfCompletionDate(): Determines if today matches the completion date\n\nThis mechanism is particularly useful for:\n\nMatching observed phenological dates in calibration\nManagement overrides for specific calendar-based events\nEnsuring germination occurs before a set emergence date\n\n\n\nUtility Methods\nThe Phenology model provides several utility methods for querying developmental state:\n\nOnStartDayOf(stageName): Returns true if today is the first day of the specified stage\nInPhase(phaseName): Returns true if currently in the named phase\nBetween(start, end): Returns true if current phase is between start and end stages (inclusive)\nBeyond(start): Returns true if current phase is at or past the specified start stage\nPhaseStartingWith(start): Returns the phase object that begins with the specified stage name\nIndexFromPhaseName(name): Returns the array index of a phase by name\nStartStagePhaseIndex(stageName): Returns the index of the phase starting with the specified stage\nEndStagePhaseIndex(stageName): Returns the index of the phase ending with the specified stage",

    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\n\nAccessing [Wheat].Phenology.FloweringDAS\nThe [Wheat].Phenology.FloweringDAS variable is typically defined as a OnEventFunction function within the Phenology component of a Wheat model.\nTo access this function within a Manager script:\n\nRetrieve the Function: Use the zone.Get() method with the path to the function, e.g., \"[Wheat].Phenology.FloweringDAS\".\nCast to OnEventFunction: Cast the retrieved object to the OnEventFunction interface, which provides the Value() method to evaluate the function.\nEvaluate the Function: Call the Value() method to obtain the current value of FloweringDAS.\n\nThis approach allows dynamic access to model functions during simulation, enabling custom management decisions based on plant development stages.\n\n\nAccessing [Wheat].Stem.N\nThe nitrogen content (N) of the Stem organ is reportable variable. To access this variable:\n\nRetrieve the Plant Model: Use zone.Get(\"[Wheat].Stem\") to obtain the Stem model.\nCast to IOrgan: Cast the Stem organ to the GenericOrgan interface, which provides access to the N property.\nRetrieve Nitrogen Content: Access the N property to get the current nitrogen content of the Stem organ.\n\nThis method enables monitoring and managing nutrient dynamics within specific plant organs during simulation."
