The `IPhaseWithTarget` interface extends the `IPhase` interface to define phenological phases that progress toward a specific target value. It provides standardized properties for tracking both the target threshold and the accumulated progress through the phase.

## Overview

The `IPhaseWithTarget` interface is implemented by phenological phases that advance based on accumulating a measurable quantity (typically thermal time in degree days) until a target threshold is reached. This interface extends the basic `IPhase` contract by adding:

- A **target value** that defines when the phase is complete
- A **progress tracker** that accumulates the quantity through the phase

Common examples include:

- Thermal time-based phases that accumulate degree days until emergence, flowering, or maturity
- Development phases that track cumulative photoperiod or vernalization units
- Growth stages that progress based on accumulated growing degree days

By standardizing these properties, the interface enables consistent implementation of target-driven phases and allows other models to query phase progress and completion criteria in a uniform way.

**Configurable and Reportable Properties**

This interface inherits all configurable properties from [IPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/IPhase.qmd) and adds:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `ProgressThroughPhase` | double | The accumulated progress through this phase (e.g., cumulative thermal time in °Cd). Can be set externally to initialize or adjust phase progress. |

**Read-Only Reportable Properties**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `Target` | double | The target value that must be reached for the phase to complete (e.g., thermal time requirement in °Cd). |
