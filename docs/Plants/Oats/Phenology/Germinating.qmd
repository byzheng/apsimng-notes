The Germinating phase represents the period from sowing to germination in oat development.

## Phase Type

[GerminatingPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GerminatingPhase.qmd)

## Timing

- **Start**: Sowing
- **End**: Germination  
- **IsEmerged**: false

## Description

Germination occurs on the day after sowing when soil conditions are suitable. For the oat model, germination will occur when:

- Soil water content at the sowing depth exceeds the lower limit (LL15), OR
- Soil temperature at sowing depth is greater than or equal to the minimum soil temperature (0°C for the standard oat parameterisation)

This phase does not accumulate thermal time - it simply checks environmental conditions to determine when germination can proceed.

## Parameters

- **MinSoilTemperature**: 0.0°C
