For C3 plants (like wheat), Radiation Use Efficiency is scaled by the $CO_{\text{2}}$ factor which is calculated by a function of environmental $CO_{\text{2}}$ concentration
($C$, ppm) and daily mean temperature ($T_{mean}$) as published
by [@reyenga_modelling_1999].

$$
f_{c}=\frac{(C-C_{i})(350+2C_{i})}{(C+2C_{i})(350-C_{i})}
$$


where $C_{i}$ is the temperature dependent $CO_{\text{2}}$ compensation
point (ppm) and is derived from the following function. 

$$
C_{i}=\frac{163-T_{mean}}{5-0.1T_{mean}}
$$
