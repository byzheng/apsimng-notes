The **Maturing** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **EndGrainFill** to **Maturity**. This phase covers the period after grain filling is complete when seeds undergo physiological maturation and begin to dry down.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **EndGrainFill** and **Maturity** stages.

- This phase starts at **EndGrainFill** and ends at **Maturity**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Physiological Maturity

During the maturing phase:

- Seeds have reached maximum dry weight
- Seed moisture content continues to decline
- Seeds transition to a quiescent state
- Chlorophyll degrades in pods and remaining plant parts
- The plant senesces completely

## Seed Changes

At physiological maturity:

- **Maximum dry weight**: Seeds have accumulated their full complement of reserves
- **Viability established**: Seeds acquire the ability to germinate
- **Moisture loss**: Seed moisture decreases toward harvest moisture levels
- **Pod color change**: Pods transition from green to brown or tan
- **Seed coat hardens**: Seeds become more resistant to mechanical damage

## Cultivar-Specific Parameters

| Name       | Description                                         | Default Value |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| [Phenology].Maturing.Target   | Thermal time for seed maturation (°Cd) | Cultivar-specific |

## Environmental Influences

The maturing phase is affected by:

1. **Temperature**: Higher temperatures accelerate maturation and drying
2. **Humidity**: Affects rate of seed moisture loss
3. **Rainfall**: Can slow drying or reduce seed quality if excessive
4. **Wind**: Influences rate of plant drying

## Practical Considerations

During the maturing phase:

- Determine optimal harvest timing based on seed moisture
- Avoid excessive delays that might lead to pod shattering
- Monitor weather for conditions favorable for harvest
- Consider pre-harvest desiccation if environmental conditions are unfavorable for drying
- Plan harvest operations to minimize seed quality loss

Proper timing of harvest relative to physiological maturity helps maximize grain yield and quality in chickpea.
