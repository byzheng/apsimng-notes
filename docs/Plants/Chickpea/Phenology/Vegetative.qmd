The **Vegetative** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **Emergence** to **EndJuvenille**. This phase covers the early vegetative growth period before the plant becomes responsive to photoperiod for floral initiation.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between the **Emergence** and **EndJuvenille** stages.

- This phase starts at **Emergence** and ends at **EndJuvenille**, when the juvenile phase is complete
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific and represents the duration of the juvenile period

## Juvenile Phase

The juvenile phase in chickpea is the period during which the plant is insensitive to photoperiod for the induction of flowering. During this phase:

- The plant focuses on vegetative growth
- Leaf area development is rapid
- Root system establishment occurs
- The plant is not yet responsive to day length cues

Only after completing the juvenile phase does the plant become sensitive to photoperiod, which then influences the transition to reproductive development.
