title: "Haun Stage"
---

Haun Stage is a measure of leaf development in oats, defined as the number of leaf tips that have appeared since emergence.

## Definition

The Haun Stage scale provides a continuous measure of leaf development:

- At emergence: Haun Stage = 0
- When first leaf tip is visible: Haun Stage = 1
- When second leaf tip appears: Haun Stage = 2
- And so on...

The Haun Stage can take fractional values between integer leaf numbers, representing partial emergence of the next leaf.

## Calculation

Haun Stage is calculated from:

$$
\text{HaunStage}_{t+1} = \text{HaunStage}_t + \frac{\Delta\text{ThermalTime}}{\text{Phyllochron}}
$$

Where:

- **ΔThermalTime**: Daily thermal time accumulation (°Cd)
- **Phyllochron**: Thermal time interval between successive leaf appearances (°Cd)

## Delta Haun Stage

The daily increment in Haun Stage (DeltaHaunStage) is used in the vernalisation calculation:

$$
\Delta\text{HaunStage} = \frac{\Delta\text{ThermalTime}}{\text{Phyllochron}}
$$

This represents the rate of leaf appearance and is used to drive vernalisation accumulation.

## Haun Stage at Terminal Spikelet

The target Haun Stage for terminal spikelet formation (HaunStageTerminalSpikelet) determines when the vegetative phase ends. This value is calculated from:

$$
\text{HSTS} = \text{MinLeafNumber} + \text{VernalLeaves} + \text{PhotoLeaves}
$$

Where:

- **MinLeafNumber**: Base leaf number (7 for standard oat parameterisation)
- **VernalLeaves**: Additional leaves due to lack of vernalisation (decreases as Vrn1 increases)
- **PhotoLeaves**: Additional leaves due to short photoperiod (decreases as day length increases)

## Usage

Haun Stage is used to:

- Track vegetative development
- Determine the timing of terminal spikelet formation
- Drive vernalisation accumulation
- Coordinate leaf appearance with other developmental processes
