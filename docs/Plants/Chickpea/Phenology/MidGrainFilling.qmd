The **MidGrainFilling** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **MidGrainFilling** to **LateGrainFilling**. This phase represents the middle portion of the grain filling period when seeds continue to accumulate dry matter.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between the **MidGrainFilling** and **LateGrainFilling** stages.

- This phase starts at **MidGrainFilling** and ends at **LateGrainFilling**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Mid Grain Filling Process

During mid grain filling:

- Grain filling rate remains high but may begin to decline
- Seeds continue to increase in weight
- Moisture content in seeds remains relatively high
- Assimilate partitioning strongly favors grain growth
- Vegetative growth has largely ceased

## Source-Sink Dynamics

At this stage:

- **Sink strength**: Grains are the dominant sink for assimilates
- **Current photosynthesis**: Continues to provide assimilates, though leaf area may be declining
- **Reserve mobilization**: Stems continue to remobilize stored carbohydrates
- **Nitrogen remobilization**: Continues from leaves and stems to grains

## Cultivar-Specific Parameters

| Name       | Description                                         | Default Value |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| [Phenology].MidGrainFilling.Target   | Thermal time for mid grain filling (°Cd) | Cultivar-specific |

## Environmental Factors

Mid grain filling is affected by:

1. **Water availability**: Continued moisture is needed for grain filling
2. **Temperature**: Moderate temperatures support optimal grain filling
3. **Leaf senescence**: Premature senescence reduces photosynthetic supply
4. **Disease pressure**: Foliar diseases reduce assimilate production

## Practical Considerations

During mid grain filling:

- Maintain irrigation if needed to prevent terminal drought stress
- Monitor for late-season diseases that could reduce photosynthesis
- Avoid unnecessary field traffic that might damage senescing plants
- Begin planning harvest timing based on crop maturity progression

The mid grain filling phase contributes significantly to final seed weight, making maintenance of plant health during this period important for maximizing yield.
