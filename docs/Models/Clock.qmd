The APSIM Clock is a central component of the APSIM simulation framework, responsible for managing the simulation time and orchestrating the sequence of events that occur during a simulation. It defines the start and end dates of the simulation and raises various events at specific times to allow different models to perform their calculations.



## Overview

The `Clock` model defines the simulation's start and end dates, controls the passage of time, and raises numerous events used to coordinate actions across models. It forms the central timing mechanism within the APSIM NG framework, driving the daily timestep loop.


## Inputs


- **Start**: The start date of the simulation with format `YYYY-MM-DD` (optional if weather data is available).
- **End**: The end date of the simulation with format `YYYY-MM-DD` (optional if weather data is available).
- **Weather**: If no explicit start/end dates are defined, the model will attempt to derive them from the associated weather model.


## Methodology

If `Start` or `End` are not defined, the model looks for a weather model in the scope and adopts its `StartDate` or `EndDate`. The simulation begins on the resolved start date and continues day by day until the end date. Each day, the `Clock` publishes multiple events to signal simulation actions across components. These include daily updates, management actions, soil processes, plant growth, CLEM processes, and reporting.


1. [`DoInitialSummary`](/docs/Models/Events.html#DoInitialSummary) – Initial summary at the start.
2. [`StartOfSimulation`](/docs/Models/Events.html#StartOfSimulation) – Marks the simulation's beginning.
3. [`FinalInitialise`](/docs/Models/Events.html#FinalInitialise) – Final initialisation before the first day.
4. [`StartOfFirstDay`](/docs/Models/Events.html#StartOfFirstDay) – First day setup.
5. For each day (from `StartDate` to `EndDate`), the following events are raised in sequence (some only on specific days): `DoCatchYesterday`, `DoWeather`, `DoDailyInitialisation`, `StartOfDay`, `StartOfMonth`, `StartOfYear`, `StartOfWeek`, `DoManagement`, `DoFertiliserApplications`, `DoPestDiseaseDamage`, `DoEnergyArbitration`, `DoSoilErosion`, `DoSoilWaterMovement`, `DoSoilTemperature`, `DoSolute`, `DoSurfaceOrganicMatterPotentialDecomposition`, `DoSoilOrganicMatter`, `DoSurfaceOrganicMatterDecomposition`, `DoUpdateWaterDemand`, `DoDCAPST`, `DoWaterArbitration`, `PrePhenology`, `DoPhenology`, `DoPotentialPlantGrowth`, `DoPotentialPlantPartioning`, `DoPastureWater`, `DoNutrientArbitration`, `DoActualPlantPartioning`, `DoActualPlantGrowth`, `PartitioningComplete`, `DoStock`, `DoLifecycle`, `DoUpdate`, `DoManagementCalculations`, `DoEndPasture`, `DoReportCalculations`, `EndOfWeek`, `EndOfYear`, `EndOfMonth`, `EndOfDay`, `DoReport`.
6. After the last day, [`EndOfSimulation`](/docs/Models/Events.html#EndOfSimulation) is raised.
