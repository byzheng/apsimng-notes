The **EarlyFlowering** phase in [Canola](/docs/Plants/Canola) represents the developmental period from **StartFlowering** to **StartPodDevelopment**. It is influenced by thermal time only.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between the `StartFlowering` and `StartPodDevelopment` stages.

- This phase starts at **StartFlowering** and ends at **StartPodDevelopment**, when the grain is considered to be fully ripe.
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function.
- The **Target thermal time** is fixed as constant for this phase, with default value of 100 °Cd [@robertson_environmental_2002].
