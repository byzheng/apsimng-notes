This section describes the **events** associated with this component. Events are signals or notifications that indicate when a particular process occurs within the simulation, or when a component needs to respond to a change in another part of the system. Some events are **listened for** by this component to trigger its processes, while others are **raised** to inform other components about changes. For a general overview of how APSIM Next Generation uses events to coordinate processes between components, see the [Events Overview](/docs/models/Events.qmd).
