Here is not the official APSIM documentation, but a collection of documentations when I am working with [APSIM](https://www.apsim.info/) Next Generation. The official documentation is available at [APSIM Documentation](https://apsimnextgeneration.netlify.app/), [Model Validation](https://docs.apsim.info/), and [APSIM GitHub](https://github.com/APSIMInitiative/ApsimX).

This documentation is not complete, and I will keep updating it as I am working with APSIM Next Generation. Feel free to contribute to this documentation by creating a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/byzheng/apsimng-notes) or create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/byzheng/apsimng-notes/issues).


## [Models](Models)

This section contains the `Models` developed in APSIM Next Generation with C# source codes under folder [Models](https://github.com/APSIMInitiative/ApsimX/tree/master/Models). These models are organised as the original folder structure in the APSIM Next Generation repository.


## [Crops](Crops)

This section contains the documentation for `Crops` models in APSIM Next Generation. The `Crops` models are released as part of the APSIM Next Generation. The model is defined under [Resources](https://github.com/APSIMInitiative/ApsimX/tree/master/Models/Resources) folder in the APSIM Next Generation repository.
