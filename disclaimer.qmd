This is not the official APSIM documentation. It is a personal collection of documentation and notes compiled while working with [APSIM Next Generation](https://www.apsim.info/). For official resources, please refer to the [APSIM Documentation](https://apsimnextgeneration.netlify.app/), [Model Validation](https://docs.apsim.info/), and the [APSIM GitHub repository](https://github.com/APSIMInitiative/ApsimX).

The content here is generated and curated from various sources, including:

- Large language models (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT)
- The APSIM NG source code
- Official APSIM documentation and online materials
- Personal communication with APSIM developers
- My own interpretation and understanding

⚠️ This documentation is **not official**, **may contain errors**, and **is not guaranteed to be complete or accurate**. It is intended as a **learning resource** for myself and others interested in APSIM NG.

**Use this material at your own risk.** I take **no responsibility for any loss, damage, or misinterpretation** resulting from the use of this material. Always consult official documentation or domain experts before relying on the information for research or production use.

I will continue to update this as I work with APSIM NG. Contributions and corrections are welcome via [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/byzheng/apsimng-notes/pulls) or [issues](https://github.com/byzheng/apsimng-notes/issues).
