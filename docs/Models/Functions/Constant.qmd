The Constant function returns a fixed value throughout the simulation. It is often used to supply a constant input (e.g., temperature threshold, fixed growth rate, photoperiod sensitivity) to other models in APSIM-NG.

## Overview

This function provides a simple way to input a value that does not change over time. It can be added wherever a numerical input is required and does not depend on environmental conditions, crop stage, or other simulation variables.

In APSIM-NG, Constant is widely used as a basic building block within more complex functions, or to define cultivar-specific constants (e.g., base temperature = 0 °C, leaf width = 10 mm). It implements the IFunction interface, making it compatible with any APSIM component that accepts functions as inputs.

**Configurable and Reportable Properties**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| FixedValue | double | The constant value to return |
| Units | string | Optional units associated with the value |

## Processes and Algorithms

{{< include /includes/_processes-intro.md >}}


This function always returns the same value, specified by the user in the FixedValue property. It does not depend on any conditions or crop stages.


## User Interface

Constant can be added as a child of any function-based node (e.g., PhaseLookupValue, MultiplyFunction, AddFunction) in the model tree. To use:

1. Right-click the parent node.
2. Select "Add Model...".
3. Search for "Constant" and select it.
4. Enter the desired numeric value and optional units.
