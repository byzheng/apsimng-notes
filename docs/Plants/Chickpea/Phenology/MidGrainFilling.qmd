The **MidGrainFilling** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **MidGrainFilling** to **LateGrainFilling**. This phase represents the middle portion of the grain filling period when seeds continue to accumulate dry matter.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between the **MidGrainFilling** and **LateGrainFilling** stages.

- This phase starts at **MidGrainFilling** and ends at **LateGrainFilling**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Mid Grain Filling Process

During mid grain filling:

- Grain filling rate remains high but may begin to decline
- Seeds continue to increase in weight
- Moisture content in seeds remains relatively high
- Assimilate partitioning strongly favors grain growth
- Vegetative growth has largely ceased
