A helper function in APSIM Next Generation that calculates vernalisation (Vrn) expression rate parameters for a given genotype, using observed final leaf number (FLN) data and controlled environment parameters. It forms a core part of the CAMP (Cereal Apical Meristem Phenology) model and supports simulation of genotype-specific developmental responses to photoperiod and vernalisation cues.

## Overview

`CalcCAMPVrnRates` is used to derive the coefficients that govern how vernalisation and photoperiod affect the expression rates of vernalisation genes in the CAMP model. It operates on FLN observations from controlled environment studies with defined photoperiod and temperature treatments. The outputs are rate parameters that quantify the rate and phase transitions of Vrn expression in different photothermal regimes, enabling genotype-specific simulation of phenological development.

This function is critical for enabling APSIM NG to simulate genotype-by-environment interactions in crop phenology, particularly for cereal crops where vernalisation and photoperiod sensitivity genes such as Vrn1, Vrn2, and Vrn3 play a pivotal role.



## Inputs

This function requires the following inputs:

- `FinalLeafNumberSet FLNset`: A dataset containing FLN values under different photoperiod and vernalisation treatments:
  - `LV` – Long photoperiod with vernalisation
  - `LN` – Long photoperiod without vernalisation
  - `SV` – Short photoperiod with vernalisation
  - `SN` – Short photoperiod without vernalisation
- `FLNParameterEnvironment EnvData`: The environmental parameters under which FLN was observed:
  - `VrnTreatTemp`: Vernalisation treatment temperature (°C)
  - `VrnTreatDuration`: Duration of vernalisation treatment (days)
  - `TreatmentPp_L`: Long-day photoperiod (hours)
  - `TtEmerge`: Thermal time from sowing to emergence (°Cd)

In addition, it links to:

- `basePhyllochron`: A child model function that returns the phyllochron (thermal time per leaf)
- `camp`: The ancestor [CAMP](CAMP.qmd) model, which provides helper methods and constants

## Methodology

The `CalcCAMPVrnRates` function estimates [vernalisation rate parameters](CultivarRateParams.qmd) using:

- `FLNset`: a set of [final leaf number parameters](FinalLeafNumberSet.qmd)
- `EnvData`: [controlled environment data](FLNParameterEnvironment.qmd) used to measure final leaf number

The function performs the following steps:

1. [Convert Emergence Duration from Thermal Time to Phyllochrons](#emergence-duration)  
2. [Base phyllochron duration of vernalisation treatment](#vern-phyllochron)  
3. [Estimate Haun Stage at Terminal Spikelet](#haun-ts)  
4. [Calculate Minimum Duration from Vernalisation Saturation to Terminal Spikelet](#min-vs)  
5. [Calculate the accumulated phyllochrons at vernalisation saturation for each treatment](#vs-phyllochrons)  
6. [Calculate Vernalisation Rates and Photoperiod Sensitivities](#vrn-rates)  
7. [Calculate Maximum Vrn2 Expression Under Long Photoperiods](#vrn2-max)  
8. [Calculate Cold-Induced Upregulation of Vrn1 Expression](#cold-vrn1)  

### Convert Emergence Duration from Thermal Time to Phyllochrons {#emergence-duration}

The duration from sowing to emergence is first expressed in phyllochrons ($Ph_\text{emergence}$) using the base phyllochron value ($Ph_\text{base}$):

$$
Ph_\text{emergence} = \frac{TT_\text{emergence}}{Ph_\text{base}}
$$

Where:

- $TT_\text{emergence}$ is the thermal time from sowing to emergence (°C·days), `TtEmerge` in [FLNParameterEnvironment.qmd](FLNParameterEnvironment.qmd),
- $Ph_\text{base}$ is the base phyllochron duration.

### Base phyllochron duration of vernalisation treatment {#vern-phyllochron}

The base phyllochron duration of the vernalisation treatment ($Ph_\text{vern}$) is calculated as:
$$
Ph_\text{vern} = \frac{T_\text{vern} \times D_\text{V}}{Ph_\text{base}}
$$

Where: 

- $T_\text{vern}$ is the vernalisation treatment temperature (°C), `VrnTreatTemp` in [FLNParameterEnvironment.qmd](FLNParameterEnvironment.qmd),
- $D_\text{V}$ is the vernalisation treatment duration (days), `VrnTreatDuration` in [FLNParameterEnvironment.qmd](FLNParameterEnvironment.qmd),
- $Ph_\text{base}$ is the base phyllochron duration.


### Estimate Haun Stage at Terminal Spikelet {#haun-ts}

The Haun Stage at terminal spikelet for each environment $e$ (e.g., LV, LN, SV, SN) is calculated following the method of @brown_integration_2013:

$$
\text{HS}_{TS}(e) = \left( \text{FLN}(e) - 2.85 \right) \times 1.1
$$

Where:

- $\text{FLN}(e)$ is the final leaf number observed under environment $e$.

### Calculate Minimum Duration from Vernalisation Saturation to Terminal Spikelet {#min-vs}

The minimum duration from vernalisation saturation to terminal spikelet ($\Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\min}$) is determined by **earliness *per se* (EPS)** genes, which define the baseline thermal time requirement in the absence of both photoperiod sensitivity and vernalisation response. This duration is expressed in phyllochrons and is estimated as:
$$
\Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\ \min} = \min\left( \text{HS}_{\text{TS, LV}} - 1.1,\ 3 \right)
$$

Where:

- $\text{HS}_{\text{TS, LV}}$ is the Haun Stage at terminal spikelet in the long-day vernalised (LV) treatment which does not have photoperiod sensitivity or vernalisation requirement,
- 1.1 is the earliest Haun Stage at which vernalisation saturation can begin,
- 3 is the maximum stage for vernalisation saturation, based on Lincoln controlled-environment data (CRWT153).


### Calculate the accumulated phyllochrons at vernalisation saturation for each treatment {#vs-phyllochrons}

The accumulated phyllochron at vernalisation saturation is estimated for each photoperiod × vernalisation treatment. These values are expressed in phyllochrons and are derived relative to the Haun Stage at terminal spikelet ($\text{HS}_{TS}$) and the previously calculated minimum duration between vernalisation saturation and terminal spikelet ($\Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\ \min}$).

**Long-day Vernalised (LV) Environment**

For the LV treatment, vernalisation saturation is assumed to occur exactly before terminal spikelet for the LV treatment:

$$
\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}} = \text{HS}_{TS,\ LV} - \Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\ \min}
$$

Where:

- $\text{HS}_{TS,\ LV}$ is the Haun Stage at terminal spikelet for the LV treatment,
- $\Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\ \min}$ is the minimum duration from vernalisation saturation to terminal spikelet.


**Long-day Non-vernalised (LN) Environment**

For LN, the vernalisation saturation timing is constrained by Haun Stage of LN at terminal spikelet ($\text{HS}_{TS,\ LN}$) and cannot occur earlier than in the LV treatment:

$$
\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LN}} = \max(\text{HS}_{TS,\ LN} - \Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\text{min}},\ \Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}})
$$

Where:

- $\text{HS}_{TS,\ LN}$ is the Haun Stage at terminal spikelet for the LN treatment,
- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}}$ is the vernalisation saturation timing for the LV treatment,
- $\Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\text{min}}$ is the minimum duration from vernalisation saturation to terminal spikelet.


This ensures the LN environment does not reach vernalisation saturation before LV.

**Short-day Vernalised (SV) Environment**

For the SV treatment, vernalisation saturation is assumed to occur at the same developmental stage as $\Delta Ph_{\text{VS, LV}}$, but not earlier than the stage at which vernalisation saturation is physiologically possible under SV conditions:
$$
\Delta Py_{\text{VS, SV}} = \min(\text{HS}_{TS,\ SV} - \Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\text{min}},\ \Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}})
$$

Where:

- $\text{HS}_{TS,\ SV}$ is the Haun Stage at terminal spikelet for the SV treatment,
- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}}$ is the vernalisation saturation duration for the LV treatment,
- $\Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\text{min}}$ is the minimum duration from vernalisation saturation to terminal spikelet.


**Short-day Non-vernalised (SN) Environment**

For the SN environment, saturation is constrained by Haun Stage of SN at terminal spikelet ($\text{HS}_{TS,\ SN}$) and cannot occur earlier than in the LV treatment:


$$
\Delta Py_{\text{VS, SN}} = \max(\text{HS}_{TS,\ SN} - \left( \text{HS}_{TS,\ SV} - \Delta Py_{\text{VS, SV}} \right),\ \Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}})
$$

Where:

- $\text{HS}_{TS,\ SN}$ is the Haun Stage at terminal spikelet for the SN treatment,
- $\text{HS}_{TS,\ SV}$ is the Haun Stage at terminal spikelet for the SV treatment,
- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, SV}}$ is the vernalisation saturation duration for the SV treatment,
- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}}$ is the vernalisation saturation duration for the LV treatment.

### Calculate Vernalisation Rates and Photoperiod Sensitivities {#vrn-rates}

The base and maximum rates of vernalisation progression during the vegetative and early reproductive phases are estimated, along with the photoperiod (Pp) sensitivity factors.

**Base Vernalisation Rate During Vegetative Phase**

Base vernalisation rate during vegetative phase ($\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}}$, `BaseDVrnVeg` in [CultivarRateParams](CultivarRateParams.qmd)) assumes vernalisation starts at germination and proceeds linearly until saturation in the SN treatment (which is short-day and non-vernalised treatment and lacks vernalising temperature and long photoperiod upregulation), the base rate is:

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}} = \frac{1}{\Delta Py_{\text{VS, SN}} + Ph_{\text{emergence}}}
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, SN}}$ is the phyllochron at vernalisation saturation for the SN treatment,
- $Ph_{\text{emergence}}$ is the phyllochron duration from sowing to emergence.

**Maximum Vernalisation Rate During Vegetative Phase**

The fastest rate of vernalisation during vegetative phase ($\Delta Vrn_{\text{max, veg}}$, `MaxDVrnVeg` in [CultivarRateParams](CultivarRateParams.qmd)) is assumed to occur in the SV treatment (i.e. short-day with vernalisation), where the rate is maximised at the minimum vernalisation saturation to terminal spikelet:

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{max, veg}} = \frac{1}{\Delta Py_{\text{VS, SV}} + Ph_{\text{emergence}}}
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, SV}}$ is the phyllochron at vernalisation saturation for the SV treatment,
- $Ph_{\text{emergence}}$ is the phyllochron duration from sowing to emergence.


**Base Vernalisation Rate During Early Reproductive Phase**

The base vernalisation rate during early reproductive phase ($\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, ER}}$, `BaseDVrnER` in [CultivarRateParams](CultivarRateParams.qmd)) is calculated as:

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, ER}} = \frac{1}{\text{HS}_{TS,\ SN} - \Delta Py_{\text{VS, SN}}}
$$

Where:

- $\text{HS}_{TS,\ SN}$ is the Haun Stage at terminal spikelet for the SN treatment,
- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, SN}}$ is the phyllochron duration at vernalisation saturation for the SN treatment.


**Maximum Vernalisation Rate During Early Reproductive Phase**

The maximum vernalisation rate during early reproductive phase ($\Delta Vrn_{\text{max, ER}}$, `MaxDVrnER` in [CultivarRateParams](CultivarRateParams.qmd)) is calculated as:

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{max, ER}} = \frac{1}{ \Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\text{min}}}
$$

Where:  

- $\Delta Ph_{\text{VS→TS},\text{min}}$ is the minimum phyllochron duration from vernalisation saturation to terminal spikelet, calculated earlier.

**Photoperiod Sensitivity Factor During Early Reproductive Phase**

The photoperiod sensitivity factor during early reproductive phase ($F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, ER}}$, `PpVrn3FactER` in [CultivarRateParams](CultivarRateParams.qmd)) is calculated as:
$$
F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, ER}} = \left( \frac{\Delta Vrn_{\text{max, ER}}}{\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, ER}}} - 1 \right) + 1
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{max, ER}}$ is the maximum vernalisation rate during early reproductive phase,
- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, ER}}$ is the base vernalisation rate during early reproductive phase.

This factor quantifies how much faster vernalisation proceeds under long photoperiod compared to the baseline.
  
**Photoperiod Sensitivity Factor During Vegetative Phase**

The photoperiod sensitivity factor during vegetative phase ($F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}}$, `PpVrn3FactVeg` in [CultivarRateParams](CultivarRateParams.qmd)) is calculated as:
$$
F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}} = \left( \frac{1 / \Delta Py_{\text{VS, LN}}}{\Delta Vrn_{\text{max, veg}}} - 1 \right) + 1
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LN}}$ is the phyllochron duration at vernalisation saturation for the LN treatment,
- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{max, veg}}$ is the maximum vernalisation rate during vegetative phase.

To ensure consistency, this factor is constrained to be no less than the early reproductive sensitivity:

$$
F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}} = \max(F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}},\ F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, ER}})
$$

Where:

- $F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}}$ is the photoperiod sensitivity factor during vegetative phase,
- $F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, ER}}$ is the photoperiod sensitivity factor during early reproductive phase.



### Calculate Maximum Vrn2 Expression Under Long Photoperiods {#vrn2-max}

The maximum vernalisation repressor (Vrn2) expression under long photoperiod conditions without vernalising temperatures ($Vrn_{\text{max, Vrn2}}$, , `MaxVrn2` in [CultivarRateParams](CultivarRateParams.qmd)) is estimated as:


Before vernalisation saturation (VS) is reached under long photoperiod without vernalisation, Vrn1 expression is influenced by both baseline and Vrn3-induced pathways. The effective rate of Vrn1 expression is:

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{Vrn1} \times \text{Vrn3}} = \max\left( \frac{1}{\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LN}}},\ \Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}} \times F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}} \right)
$$

Where:

- $\frac{1}{\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LN}}}$ is the rate assuming linear accumulation from sowing to saturation without upregulation,
- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}}$ is the base Vrn1 rate,
- $F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}}$ is the photoperiod (Vrn3) sensitivity factor in the vegetative phase.

**Duration of Effective Vrn1 × Vrn3 Expression Phase**

The time (in Haun stages) needed to reach saturation at the above rate is:

$$
H_{\text{Vrn1} \times \text{Vrn3}} = \frac{1}{\Delta Vrn_{\text{Vrn1} \times \text{Vrn3}}}
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{Vrn1} \times \text{Vrn3}}$ is the effective rate of Vrn1 × Vrn3 expression,
- $H_{\text{Vrn1} \times \text{Vrn3}}$ is the duration of effective Vrn1 × Vrn3 expression in Haun stages.


This represents the duration over which the effective Vrn1 × Vrn3 expression occurs in the absence of vernalisation.

**Haun Stage When Vrn2 Expression Ends**

Vrn2 expression is assumed to end just before Vrn1 × Vrn3 takes effect. This occurs $H_{\text{Vrn1} \times \text{Vrn3}}$ stages prior to saturation:

$$
\text{EndVrn2}_{\text{LN}} = \max\left(0,\ \Delta Py_{\text{VS, LN}} - H_{\text{Vrn1} \times \text{Vrn3}} \right)
$$

Where:

- $\text{EndVrn2}_{\text{LN}}$ is the Haun stage when Vrn2 expression ends in the LN treatment,
- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LN}}$ is the phyllochron at vernalisation saturation for the LN treatment,
- $H_{\text{Vrn1} \times \text{Vrn3}}$ is the duration of effective Vrn1 × Vrn3 expression in Haun stages.


This value is constrained to be non-negative.

**Maximum Vrn2 Expression Under Long Photoperiods**

The total Vrn2 expression is assumed to accumulate linearly from emergence to the end of Vrn2 activity under baseline Vrn1 expression:

$$
Vrn_{\text{max, Vrn2}} = \left( \text{EndVrn2}_{\text{LN}} + Ph_{\text{emergence}} \right) \times \Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}}
$$

Where:

- $\text{EndVrn2}_{\text{LN}}$ is the Haun stage when Vrn2 expression ends in the LN treatment,
- $Ph_{\text{emergence}}$ is the phyllochron duration from sowing to emergence,
- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}}$ is the base Vrn1 expression rate during the vegetative phase.

This value represents the maximum repressive effect of Vrn2 that must be overcome before Vrn3-mediated acceleration of Vrn1 expression can begin.

### Calculate Cold-Induced Upregulation of Vrn1 Expression {#cold-vrn1}

The effect of cold treatment on persistent (methylated) upregulation of **Vrn1** expression in the **LV** (long photoperiod + vernalisation) environment  ($$C_{\text{Vrn1}}$$, `ColdVrn1Fact` in [CultivarRateParams](CultivarRateParams.qmd)) is estimated as:

**Baseline Vrn1 Expression up to VS in the LV Treatment**

The total amount of Vrn1 expressed under baseline conditions in the LV treatment from sowing to vernalisation saturation is:

$$
Vrn_{\text{base, LV}} = (Ph_\text{emergence} + \Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}}) \times \Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}}
$$

Where:

- $Ph_\text{emergence}$ is the phyllochron duration from sowing to emergence,
- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}}$ is the phyllochron duration at vernalisation saturation for the LV treatment,
- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}}$ is the baseline rate of Vrn1 expression during the vegetative phase.

This reflects the cumulative Vrn1 expression in the absence of cold-specific upregulation.

**Amount of Cold-Induced Persistent Vrn1 Expression**

Cold upregulation of Vrn1 (assumed to lead to methylation and memory) is calculated as:

$$
Vrn_{\text{cold, LV}} = Vrn_{\text{threshold}} + Vrn_{\text{max, Vrn2}} - Vrn_{\text{base, LV}}
$$

Where:

- $Vrn_{\text{threshold}}$ is the saturation threshold for Vrn1 (typically 1),
- $Vrn_{\text{max, Vrn2}}$ is the maximum Vrn2 repressive expression,
- $Vrn_{\text{base, LV}}$ is the amount of Vrn1 expressed at baseline up to VS.

**Methylation Threshold**

The methylation threshold ($\theta_{\text{meth}}$, `MethalationThreshold` in [CultivarRateParams](CultivarRateParams.qmd)) (i.e., amount of Vrn1 needed for full persistent response) is assumed to be equal to the cold-induced Vrn1 amount:

$$
\theta_{\text{meth}} = V_{\text{cold, LV}}
$$

This assumption is based on findings by Brooking and Jamieson that the lag before methylation equals the duration of vernalisation response.

**Effective Duration of Vernalisation**

The duration (in Haun stages) over which vernalisation is active is:

$$
H_{\text{vern, LV}} = \min(Ph_\text{vern},\ Ph_\text{emergence} + \Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}})
$$

Where:
- $Ph_\text{vern}$ is the phyllochron duration of the vernalisation treatment,
- $Ph_\text{emergence}$ is the phyllochron duration from sowing to emergence,
- $\Delta Py_{\text{VS, LV}}$ is the phyllochron duration at vernalisation saturation for the LV treatment.


**Cold-Induced Vrn1 Expression Rate During Treatment**

The total rate of Vrn1 expression under cold treatment is:

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{cold, LV}} = \frac{Vrn_{\text{cold, LV}} + \theta_{\text{meth}}}{H_{\text{vern, LV}}}
$$

Where:

- $Vrn_{\text{cold, LV}}$ is the amount of cold-induced Vrn1 expression,
- $\theta_{\text{meth}}$ is the methylation threshold,
- $H_{\text{vern, LV}}$ is the effective duration of vernalisation in Haun stages.

**Maximum Cold-Induced Expression Rate at 0°C**

Assuming an exponential temperature effect, the maximum rate of Vrn1 expression under cold is:

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{cold, max}} = \frac{\Delta Vrn_{\text{cold, LV}}}{\exp(k \cdot T_{\text{cold}})}
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{cold, LV}}$ is the cold-induced Vrn1 expression rate during the vernalisation treatment,
- $k$ is the temperature coefficient for vernalisation (typically -0.17),
- $T_{\text{cold}}$ is the vernalisation treatment temperature, `VrnTreatTemp` in [FLNParameterEnvironment](FLNParameterEnvironment.qmd).

**Cold-Induced Vrn1 Upregulation Factor**

The cold upregulation factor ($F_{\text{cold, vrn1}}$, `ColdVrn1Fact` in [CultivarRateParams](CultivarRateParams.qmd)) is calculated as the ratio of cold-enhanced Vrn1 expression to baseline expression:

$$
F_{\text{cold, vrn1}} = \frac{\Delta Vrn_{\text{cold, max}}}{\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}}}
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{cold, max}}$ is the maximum cold-induced Vrn1 expression rate at 0°C,
- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}}$ is the baseline Vrn1 expression rate during the vegetative phase.


This factor quantifies the enhancement in Vrn1 expression due to cold during vernalisation.
