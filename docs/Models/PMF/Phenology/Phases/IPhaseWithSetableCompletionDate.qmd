The `IPhaseWithSetableCompletionDate` interface extends phenological phases by allowing external specification of a fixed completion date. This enables users to override the phase's normal progression logic and force completion on a specific calendar date.

## Overview

The `IPhaseWithSetableCompletionDate` interface provides a mechanism for externally controlling when a phenological phase completes, bypassing the phase's normal environmental or developmental progression logic. 

The interface is intentionally minimal, adding only a single property to enable this date-based override functionality. Phases implementing this interface maintain their normal progression logic but check the `DateToProgress` property first—if set, the date override takes precedence over environmental calculations.


## Model Variables

**Configurable and Reportable Properties**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `DateToProgress` | string | Calendar date on which the phase should complete, formatted as "d-MMM" (e.g., "15-Oct", "1-Apr"). When set, this overrides the phase's normal progression logic. When empty or null, the phase progresses normally based on environmental drivers. |

**Read-Only Reportable Properties**
