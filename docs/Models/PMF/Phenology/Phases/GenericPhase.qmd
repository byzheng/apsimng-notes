The `GenericPhase` is a phenological phase used within a plant's developmental sequence. It simulates a growth phase that progresses in proportion to accumulated thermal time and completes once a specified target thermal time (in °Cd) is reached.

## Overview

The `GenericPhase` advances development using daily thermal time accumulation. The phase begins at a defined start stage and is considered complete once the cumulative thermal time equals or exceeds a specified target value.

* Daily progression is configured from property `Progression` (in general it is daily thermal time, e.g. `[Phenology].ThermalTime`).
* The target thermal time is configured via the property `Target` (in Cd).
* The progress through this phase is tracked by the `FractionComplete` property, which returns a value between 0 and 1.
* The phase transitions to the next stage once `FractionComplete` reaches 1.

If the previous phase finishes mid-day (i.e., progress overshoots the target), the unused fraction of the day's progress is passed to this phase.

## Usage

A `GenericPhase` can be used to represent phases such as "Grain Filling" which are mainly impacted by temperature without interactions with vernalisation and photoperiod.
