    "text": "Overview\nIn APSIM NG, the Phenology model manages the simulation of plant development by organizing the crop lifecycle into distinct phases. Each phase corresponds to a physiological process or stage in the crop’s development (e.g., emergence, flowering, maturity). The transition between phases is typically governed by progression to completion. In general, the progression is influenced by factors such as thermal time, photoperiod, and vernalisation.\nThis model tracks the current phase, calculates progression based on progression to completion in current phase, and allows transitions to be triggered either naturally (via progression to completion) or manually (via SetToStage). The phenology model plays a pivotal role in coordinating developmental processes with other sub-models like canopy, roots, and biomass.",

To access this variable:\n\nRetrieve the Plant Model: Use zone.Get(\"[Wheat].Stem\") to obtain the Stem model.\nCast to IOrgan: Cast the Stem organ to the GenericOrgan interface, which provides access to the N property.\nRetrieve Nitrogen Content: Access the N property to get the current nitrogen content of the Stem organ.\n\nThis method enables monitoring and managing nutrient dynamics within specific plant organs during simulation."

    "text": "Explanation\nThe Weather model in APSIM contains a CO2 property, which determines the atmospheric CO₂ concentration used in crop growth and development calculations. This property is normally updated with each day’s weather data.\nBy subscribing to the PreparingNewWeatherData event, the script intercepts the process before daily weather values are applied. This allows you to override the CO₂ value dynamically for the duration of the simulation.\nThis approach is particularly useful for experiments involving elevated CO₂ or simulating long-term climate change effects where static weather files are used but require changes in CO₂ independently."

However, this potential growth must be adjusted according to nutrient constraints, primarily nitrogen (N), which depends on nitrogen supply.\nThe NutrientConstrainedAllocationMethod model is responsible for scaling biomass allocations to organs based on the amount of nitrogen allocated to those organs. This ensures that growth is biologically feasible given available N and minimum nitrogen concentration.",

Its purpose is to:\n\nCheck whether each organ has received enough nitrogen to support its allocated biomass (i.e. satisfy the minimum concentration).\nScale biomass down proportionally if nitrogen is insufficient.\nTrack how much biomass was reduced due to nitrogen limitations (i.e. the difference between allocated and actual biomass).

The constrained growth for each organ is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nN_\\text{ConstrainedGrowth}[i] = \\frac{N_\\text{TotalAllocation}[i]}{\\text{Organs}[i]_\\text{MinNConc}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(N_\\text{TotalAllocation}[i]\\) is the total nitrogen allocated to organ \\(i\\)\n\\(\\text{Organs}[i]_\\text{MinNConc}\\) is the minimum nitrogen concentration required for organ \\(i\\)\n\nThis yields a per-organ limit on biomass, ensuring growth is feasible under nitrogen constraints. This is the most common case where nitrogen limits growth.\n\nScale Biomass Allocation Proportionally\n\nThe total biomass previously allocated (structural + metabolic + storage) is compared to ConstrainedGrowth[i].\nIf total allocation exceeds the constrained limit, all organs are scaled proportionally:\nLet:\nLet \\(DM_{total}[i]\\) be the total biomass allocated to organ \\(i\\):\n\\[\nDM_{total}[i] = DM_{structural}[i] + DM_{metabolic}[i] + DM_{storage}[i]\n\\]\nCalculate the proportion of each component:\n\\[\nP_{structural}[i] = \\frac{DM_{structural}[i]}{DM_{total}[i]}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{metabolic}[i] = \\frac{DM_{metabolic}[i]}{DM_{total}[i]}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{storage}[i] = \\frac{DM_{storage}[i]}{DM_{total}[i]}\n\\]\nScale each component by the N-constrained growth:\n\\[\nDM_{structural}[i] = \\min\\left(DM_{structural}[i], N_{constrained}[i] \\times P_{structural}[i]\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nDM_{metabolic}[i] = \\min\\left(DM_{metabolic}[i], N_{constrained}[i] \\times P_{metabolic}[i]\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nDM_{storage}[i] = \\min\\left(DM_{storage}[i], N_{constrained}[i] \\times P_{storage}[i]\\right)\n\\]\nThis ensures:\n\nNo component exceeds the N-limited capacity.\nRatios between structural, metabolic, and storage biomass are preserved.\n\n\nUpdate Final Biomass and Stress Report\n\nAfter applying constraints, updating the final biomass allocation and calculating the nutrient limitation is done as follows:\n\\[\nDM_\\text{Allocated} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( DM_{structural}[i] + DM_{metabolic}[i] + DM_{storage}[i] \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nDM_\\text{NutrientLimitation} = DM_\\text{PreNStressAllocation} - DM_\\text{Allocated}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(DM_\\text{Allocated}\\) is the total biomass realized after N constraints.\n\\(DM_\\text{PreNStressAllocation}\\) is the total biomass allocated before applying N constraints.\n\\(DM_\\text{NutrientLimitation}\\) is the biomass lost due to insufficient nitrogen.",

This approach ensures that nitrogen demand reflects both the developmental stage (timed by thermal accumulation) and the actual sink size (number of kernels), providing a biologically realistic and process-driven estimate of daily grain nitrogen requirements.\nA linear nitrogen filling rate is assumed, meaning that the demand increases uniformly from anthesis to the end of grain filling. This is a simplification but is commonly used in crop models to represent nitrogen uptake during grain development.",

This model is a key part of the crop’s phenology (developmental timing), which is crucial for understanding when the plant will reach important stages like flowering and grain filling.\nLeaf appearance rate is influenced by temperature (how warm it is), the plant’s stage of development (which leaf is appearing), and the length of the day (photoperiod).

    "text": "Methodology\nThe Phyllochron model is based on the idea that the time between new leaf appearances (measured in degree-days, or °C·days) is not constant. Instead, it changes depending on the leaf’s position on the plant and the day length.\nThe effective phyllochron (\\(P_{\\text{eff}}\\)) is calculated as:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{eff}} = P_{\\text{base}} \\times f_{\\text{leaf}}(n) \\times f_{\\text{pp}}(d)\n\\]\n\n\\(P_{\\text{base}}\\) is the base phyllochron (default: 120 °C·days), representing the typical interval between leaves under standard conditions for leaf rank from 3 to 7.\n\\(f_{\\text{leaf}}(n)\\) is a factor that adjusts the phyllochron depending on which leaf is appearing (\\(n\\) is the leaf cohort number).\n\\(f_{\\text{pp}}(d)\\) is a modifier that accounts for the effect of day length (\\(d\\) is the photoperiod in hours).\n\n\nLeaf Stage Factor\nThe rate at which new leaves appear changes as the plant grows. Early leaves appear faster, while later leaves take longer (Jamieson et al. 1998). This is represented by a piecewise function:\n\n\n\nLeaf Cohort Number (\\(n\\))\nFactor\n\n\n\n\n0–2\n0.75\n\n\n3–7\n1.0\n\n\n8+\n1.4\n\n\n\nThis means the first 2 leaves appear more quickly, leaves in the middle appear at a standard rate, and later leaves appear more slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaf Stage Factor as a Function of Leaf Cohort Number\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoperiod Effect\nThe model also accounts for how sensitive the plant is to day length with 6 degrees twilight. When days are short (less than 12 hours), leaf appearance slows down. The photoperiod effect is calculated as:\n\\[\nf_{\\text{pp}}(d) = 1 + S \\cdot f_d(d)\n\\]\n\n\\(S\\) is the photoperiod sensitivity (a parameter that can be adjusted for different varieties). \\(S\\) is typically set to 0.6 for wheat, which means the phyllochron increases by 60% (i.e. \\(120 \\times (1 + 0.6) = 192\\) °C·days) when day length is less than 8 hours, and not at all (i.e. \\(120 \\times (1 + 0) = 120\\) °C·days) when it is above 12 hours.\n\\(f_d(d)\\) describes how the effect changes with day length:\n\n\n\n\nDay Length (h)\nModifier \\(f_d(d)\\)\n\n\n\n\n8\n1.0\n\n\n12\n0.0\n\n\n20\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoperiod Effect on Phyllochron\n\n\n\n\nSo, for day lengths below 12 hours, the phyllochron increases (leaves appear more slowly), but above 12 hours, there is no further effect.",
