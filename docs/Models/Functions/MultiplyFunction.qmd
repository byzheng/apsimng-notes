The `MultiplyFunction` is a utility function that returns the **product of values** from all of its child functions.


## Overview

The `MultiplyFunction` is used to multiply multiple values for a mathematical equation. It calculates the product values of all children functions and returns the total product. This is useful when you need to combine multiple traits or parameters into a single value for further calculations in plant growth models.

A key performance feature of this function is that it returns zero as soon as any child function returns zero, which can improve computational efficiency. To maximize performance, child functions that are more likely to return zero should be placed at the top of the list of children.

### Multiplication Calculation

The function calculates the product of all child function values using the following algorithm:

$$
V = \prod_{i=1}^{n} F_i
$$

where:

- $V$ is the final value returned by the MultiplyFunction
- $F_i$ is the value of the $i$-th child function
- $n$ is the total number of child functions

**Performance Optimization:** The calculation short-circuits when any child function returns zero, immediately returning 0.0 without evaluating remaining child functions. This optimization means that ordering child functions strategically (with those most likely to be zero at the top) can significantly improve computational efficiency.


## User Interface

`MultiplyFunction` can be added as a child of any node in the model tree. Right-click the parent node, select "Add Model...", and search for `MultiplyFunction` in the Filter Box. A symbol for the `MultiplyFunction` is displayed in the user interface to represent the function.

## Practical Example

The target thermal time from germination to emergence in the wheat model is determined by ShootLag ($ShootLag$), Sowing Depth ($SowingDepth$), and Shoot Rate ($ShootRate$).

$$
TT = ShootLag + (SowingDepth \times ShootRate)
$$

The `MultiplyFunction` is used to multiply these two values to get the total target thermal time in the equation above.
