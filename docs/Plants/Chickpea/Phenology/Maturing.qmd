The **Maturing** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **EndGrainFill** to **Maturity**. This phase covers the period after grain filling is complete when seeds undergo physiological maturation and begin to dry down.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **EndGrainFill** and **Maturity** stages.

- This phase starts at **EndGrainFill** and ends at **Maturity**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific [@robertson_simulation_2002].

## Physiological Maturity

During the maturing phase:

- Seeds have reached maximum dry weight
- Seed moisture content continues to decline
- Seeds transition to a quiescent state
- Chlorophyll degrades in pods and remaining plant parts
- The plant senesces completely

## Seed Changes

At physiological maturity:

- **Maximum dry weight**: Seeds have accumulated their full complement of reserves
- **Viability established**: Seeds acquire the ability to germinate
- **Moisture loss**: Seed moisture decreases toward harvest moisture levels
- **Pod color change**: Pods transition from green to brown or tan
- **Seed coat hardens**: Seeds become more resistant to mechanical damage
