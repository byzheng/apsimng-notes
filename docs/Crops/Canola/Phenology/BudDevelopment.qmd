The **BudDevelopment** phase in [Canola](/docs/Crops/Canola) represents the developmental period from **FloralInitiation** to **GreenBud**. It is influenced by thermal time only.

## Overview

The [SimpleLeafAppearancePhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/SimpleLeafAppearancePhase.qmd) model simulates the time between the `FloralInitiation` and `GreenBud` stages with following parameters:

- **Start**: **FloralInitiation**
- **End**: **GreenBud**
- **IsEmerged**: TRUE
- **TargetLeafNumber**: as [FinalLeafNumber](/docs/Crops/Canola/Leaf/FinalLeafNumber.qmd) in [Leaf](/docs/Crops/Canola/Leaf/index.qmd) model.
- **CurrentLeafNumber**: as [NodeNumber](/docs/Crops/Canola/Leaf/NodeNumber.qmd) in [Leaf](/docs/Crops/Canola/Leaf/index.qmd) model
