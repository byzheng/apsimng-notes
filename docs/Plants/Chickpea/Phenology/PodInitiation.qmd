The **PodInitiation** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **EndFlowering** to **EndPodInitiation**. This phase covers the period after flowering ceases when initiated pods continue to develop and reach their final number.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **EndFlowering** and **EndPodInitiation** stages.

- This phase starts at **EndFlowering** and ends at **EndPodInitiation**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Pod Development

During the pod initiation phase:

- Pods that were initiated during flowering continue to enlarge
- Some pod abortion may occur under stress conditions
- Final pod number is established
- Early-formed pods begin grain filling while later pods are still developing
- The plant's assimilate demand increases as pods develop

## Pod Set and Abortion

Pod set in chickpea is influenced by:

- **Assimilate availability**: Competition between vegetative growth, pod development, and grain filling
- **Environmental stress**: Water deficit or heat stress can cause pod abortion
- **Position on plant**: Lower pods typically have higher retention than upper pods
- **Nutrient status**: Nitrogen availability affects pod retention

## Cultivar-Specific Parameters

| Name       | Description                                         | Default Value |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| [Phenology].PodInitiation.Target   | Thermal time for pod initiation (°Cd) | Cultivar-specific |

## Practical Considerations

The pod initiation phase affects:

1. **Final pod number**: Determines maximum pods that will contribute to yield
2. **Yield potential**: Pod number is a key yield component
3. **Management importance**: Critical period for maintaining water and nutrient supply
4. **Stress sensitivity**: Pod abortion under stress reduces yield
5. **Resource allocation**: Competition for assimilates between organs

Maintaining optimal growing conditions during pod initiation helps maximize pod retention and yield potential in chickpea.
