The Cereal Apical Meristem Phenology (CAMP) model is a mechanistic framework for simulating the developmental progression of temperate cereals from germination through to reproductive initiation. CAMP integrates molecular-level vernalisation gene expression (Vrn1, Vrn2, Vrn3) with phyllochron-based leaf appearance to predict final leaf number and flowering time in response to temperature and photoperiod.

## Overview

The CAMP model [@brown_integration_2013] is based on @kirby_analysis_1988's framework, which assumes that the timing of anthesis results from the timing of flag leaf appearance plus an additional thermal time period from flag leaf to heading and anthesis. The timing of flag leaf appearance is determined by the Final Leaf Number (FLN), which sets a developmental target, and the leaf appearance rate, which determines the rate of progress toward that target. Leaf appearance rate is a function of thermal time and a genotype-specific phyllochron that varies with Haun stage as described by @jamieson_sirius:_1998.

The CAMP model simulates molecular responses to temperature and photoperiod signals that regulate flowering transitions, including upregulation of Vrn1, Vrn2, and Vrn3 genes. These genes regulate the timing of key developmental transitions, particularly the completion of vernalisation and initiation of the reproductive phase.

Progress through the vernalising phase is determined by the apparent expression of Vrn1 and Vrn2 genes: Vrn1 is the gene that orchestrates cold temperature responses in development. To complete the vernalising stage, Vrn1 expression must first reach a threshold of at least 1.0. In warm temperatures (above 18 °C), Vrn1 is expressed at a genotype-dependent base rate. This base rate is lower for vernalisation-sensitive genotypes, which develop slower under warm conditions. However, exposure to cold temperatures accelerates Vrn1 expression, causing vernalisation-sensitive varieties to reach this stage at a lower Haun stage.

Vrn2 is upregulated by longer photoperiods and acts as a repressor of Vrn3, which is essential for progression to spikelet initiation. Vrn1 in turn represses Vrn2. Thus, higher photoperiod-induced Vrn2 expression raises the Vrn1 target above 1.0, extending the vernalisation phase. Conversely, shorter days reduce the Vrn1 target, a phenomenon known as *short-day vernalisation*. Vrn3 may also contribute to the acceleration of Vrn1 expression during vernalisation, a process represented by a composite parameter VrnX in the CAMP model.

The CAMP model integrates molecular and physiological representations to better capture genotype × environment × management (G×E×M) interactions and to provide a mechanistic bridge between genetic parameters and field-level crop behavior. All gene expressions are derived daily based on Haun stage increment, temperature, and photoperiod.

### Genetic Control of Phenology

Three groups of genes are involved in cereal phenology:

1. **Vernalisation genes (VRN)**: These genes promote flowering in response to prolonged exposure to cold temperatures.
2. **Photoperiod sensitivity genes (PPD)**: These genes regulate flowering time based on day length.
3. **Earliness per se genes (EPS)**: These genes control the rate of development independently of environmental cues.

Four treatments are used to represent the major gene effects on phenology [@bloomfield_vernalisation_2023; @zheng_quantification_2013]:

| Treatment | Description | VRN | PPD | EPS |
|-----------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|
| `LV`      | Long photoperiod with vernalisation| ✓   | ✓   | ✓   |
| `LN`      | Long photoperiod without vernalisation| ✗   | ✓   | ✓   |
| `SV`      | Short photoperiod with vernalisation| ✓   | ✗   | ✓   |
| `SN`      | Short photoperiod without vernalisation| ✗   | ✗   | ✓   |

Vernalisation genes are activated by exposure to low temperatures following seed germination.

## Processes and Algorithms

{{< include /_includes/Models/processes-intro.md >}}

### Parameterisation

Genotype-specific rates of gene expression in CAMP are defined by [FLNparams](FinalLeafNumberSet.qmd), which includes:

- **MinLN**: Base final leaf number under full vernalisation and long photoperiod.
- **PpLN**: Increase in FLN when grown under short photoperiod (e.g. 8h) after full vernalisation.
- **VrnLN**: Increase in FLN due to lack of vernalisation when grown under short photoperiod.
- **VxPLN**: Modification to FLN due to photoperiod interaction under unvernalised conditions.


Controlled environment conditions under which final leaf number ([FinalLeafNumberSet](FinalLeafNumberSet.qmd)) was observed and defined by [EnvData](FLNParameterEnvironment.qmd):

- **VrnTreatTemp**: Temperature (°C) used during the vernalisation treatment.
- **VrnTreatDuration**: Number of days the plants were exposed to the vernalising temperature.
- **TreatmentPp_L**: Photoperiod (hours) during the long-day photoperiod treatment.
- **TtEmerge**: Measured thermal time (°Cd) from sowing to emergence.


### On [Plant Sowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing)

When the plant is sown, the CAMP model 

* resets all vernalisation gene expressions,
* calculates [vernalisation rate parameters](CultivarRateParams.qmd) using a set of [final leaf number parameters](FinalLeafNumberSet.qmd) and [controlled environment data](FLNParameterEnvironment.qmd).

### On [Seed Imbibed](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#SeedImbibed)

When the seed is imbibed after germination, the CAMP model set `isImbibed` to true, indicating that the seed has absorbed water and is ready for germination. 

### ON [Plant Emerged](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantEmerged)

When the plant emerges, the CAMP model set `IsEmerged` to true, indicating that the plant has successfully emerged from the soil. 


### On [Pre Phenology](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PrePhenology)

In each day before phenology calculations, the CAMP model updates the expression of Vrn1, Vrn2, and Vrn3 based on current Haun stage, temperature, and photoperiod. The rate of gene expression is genotype-specific and internally derived from FLN parameters.

- **Vrn1** is expressed at a base rate under warm conditions, increasing under colder temperatures. The total expression includes both base and cold-driven components. Once Vrn1 expression exceeds the threshold of 1.0, the plant is considered vernalised.
- **Vrn2** is upregulated by long photoperiods. It inhibits Vrn3 expression and must be repressed (via increased Vrn1) before reproductive development can proceed.
- **Vrn3** is upregulated after vernalisation is complete and is necessary for terminal spikelet initiation. Its expression accelerates phenological progression.

The following steps are performed on event `PrePhenology`:

#### Calculate daily Haun Stage changes

Whether the crop has `emerged` is determined by whether the current phase represents development above the soil surface — that is, the phase itself occurs above ground or comes after emergence in most plants.

If the crop has not `emerged`, the Haun Stage delta ($\Delta HS$) is estimated based on daily thermal time ($TT$) and a base phyllochron:

$$
\Delta HS = \frac{TT}{Ph_\text{base}} \times F_{\text{emgDur}}
$$

Where:

- $Ph_\text{base}$ is the base phyllochron (thermal time per leaf appearance) for the crop, is a factor that slows down leaf appearance
- $F_{\text{emgDur}}$ is a factor that accounts for the duration of emergence, which is set to 1.0 if the accumulated thermal time since sowing does not exceed 90°C·d.

If the accumulated thermal time since sowing exceeds 90°C·d, a correction factor is applied to account for prolonged or delayed emergence conditions:


$$
F_{\text{emgDur}} = e^{-0.015 \times ( \sum_{t = t_{\text{sow}}}^{t_{\text{today}}} TT_t - 90)}
$$

Where:

-  $\sum_{t = \text{sow}}^{\text{today}} TT_t$ is the cumulative thermal time from sowing to today.


If the crop **has emerged**, $\Delta HS$ is calculated from the model input variable `deltaHaunStage`. In general, this variable is updated daily based on the daily thermal time and actual phyllochron.


#### Base and Maximum Vernalisation Expression

Gene expression is divided into:

- $Vrn_{\text{base}}$: Baseline vernalisation expression, which is the cumulative amount of Vrn1 expressed under baseline conditions,
- $Vrn_{\text{max}}$: Maximum vernalisation expression, which is the cumulative amount of Vrn1 expressed under maximum conditions (e.g. cold temperatures),
- $F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3}}$: Photoperiod factor for Vrn3 expression, which is the factor that modifies Vrn3 expression based on photoperiod


- If not yet vernalised, e.g. from sowing to vernalisation saturation:

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{base}} = \Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}} \times \Delta HS
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, veg}}$ is the baseline rate of Vrn1 expression during the vegetative phase, which is derived from the [calcCAMPVrnRates](CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) submodule at event [PlantSowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing),
- $\Delta HS$ is the daily Haun stage increment.

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{max}} = \Delta Vrn_{\text{max, veg}} \times \Delta HS
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{max, veg}}$ is the maximum rate of Vrn1 expression during the vegetative phase, also derived from the [calcCAMPVrnRates](CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) submodule at event [PlantSowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing),
- $\Delta HS$ is the daily Haun stage increment.

$$
F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3}} = F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}}
$$

Where:

- $F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}}$ is the photoperiod factor for Vrn3 expression during the vegetative phase, derived from the [calcCAMPVrnRates](CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) submodule at event [PlantSowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing).


- If vernalised but not reproductive, e.g. from vernalisation saturation to floral initiation:

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{base}} = \Delta Vrn_{\text{base, ER}} \times \Delta HS
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{base, ER}}$ is the baseline rate of Vrn1 expression during the early reproductive phase, derived from the [calcCAMPVrnRates](CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) submodule at event [PlantSowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing),
- $\Delta HS$ is the daily Haun stage increment.

$$
\Delta Vrn_{\text{max}} = \Delta Vrn_{\text{max, ER}} \times \Delta HS
$$

Where:

- $\Delta Vrn_{\text{max, ER}}$ is the maximum rate of Vrn1 expression during the early reproductive phase, derived from the [calcCAMPVrnRates](CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) submodule at event [PlantSowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing),
- $\Delta HS$ is the daily Haun stage increment.

$$
F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3}} = F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, ER}}
$$

Where:

- $F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, ER}}$ is the photoperiod factor for Vrn3 expression during the early reproductive phase, derived from the [calcCAMPVrnRates](CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) submodule at event [PlantSowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing).


$Vrn_{\text{base}}$ and $Vrn _{\text{max}}$ are accumulated since `isImbibed` is true, in general starting from germination.

$$
Vrn_{\text{base}} = \sum_{t = \text{imbibed}}^{\text{today}} \Delta Vrn_{\text{base}}
$$

$$
Vrn_{\text{max}} = \sum_{t = \text{imbibed}}^{\text{today}} \Delta Vrn_{\text{max}}
$$


#### Cold Vernalisation (Vrn1)

Cold response affects Vrn1 expression:

$$
\Delta Cold = R_{\text{cold,\ vrn}} \times \Delta Vrn_{\text{base}} \times F_{\text{cold, vrn1}}
$$

Where:

- $R_{\text{cold,\ vrn}}$ is the cold upregulation response for Vrn1 expression, specified by the input child function `ColdVrnResponse`,
- $F_{\text{cold, vrn1}}$ is the cold upregulation factor for Vrn1 expression, derived from the [calcCAMPVrnRates](CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) submodule at event [PlantSowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing).


Then the total `Cold` exposure is accumulated since imbibition (i.g. germination):

$$
Cold = \sum_{t = \text{imbibed}}^{\text{today}} \Delta Cold
$$

If cold exposure surpasses a methylation threshold $\theta_{\text{meth}}$, which is derived from the [calcCAMPVrnRates](CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) submodule at event [PlantSowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing). Changes of Vrn1 expression is equal to changes of cold exposure:

$$
\Delta Vrn1 = \Delta Cold \qquad \text{if}\ Cold\ \geq \theta_{\text{meth}}
$$

Then the total Vrn1 expression is accumulated since imbibition (i.g. germination):
$$
Vrn1 = \sum_{t = \text{imbibed}}^{\text{today}} \Delta Vrn1
$$

#### Photoperiod Response and Vrn2/Vrn3

Vrn2 expression is set as relative to the maximum vernalisation expression ($Vrn_{\text{max}}$) and photoperiod response before vernalisation saturation:

$$
Vrn2 = Vrn_{\text{max}} \times R_{\text{Pp}}
$$

Where:

- $R_{\text{PP}}$ is the photoperiod response for Vrn2 expression, specified by the input child function `PpResponse`,
- $V_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum vernalisation expression, derived from the [calcCAMPVrnRates](CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) submodule at event [PlantSowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing).

Photoperiod gene expression is active only if `isEmerged` is true, i.e. **after emergence** in general.

$$
\begin{align}
\Delta Vrn3 = \left( F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3}} - 1\right) \times R_{\text{Pp}} \times \Delta V_{\text{base}} \\
\qquad \ \qquad if\quad  Vrn_{\text{base}} + Vrn1 > Vrn2
\end{align}
$$



Where:

- $F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3}}$ is the photoperiod factor for Vrn3 expression, derived from the [calcCAMPVrnRates](CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) submodule at event [PlantSowing](/docs/Models/Events.qmd#PlantSowing),
- $R_{\text{PP}}$ is the photoperiod response for Vrn1 expression, specified by the input child function `PpResponse`,
- $\Delta V_{\text{base}}$ is the baseline rate of Vrn1 expression.


Then the total Vrn3 expression is accumulated since imbibition (i.g. germination):
$$
Vrn3 = \sum_{t = \text{imbibed}}^{\text{today}} \Delta Vrn3
$$



#### Final Vernalisation Level (Vrn)

The total vernalisation expression ($Vrn$) is accumulated from imbibition (i.e. germination) as follows:

- If not vernalised:

$$
Vrn = Vrn_{\text{base}} + Vrn1 + Vrn3 - Vrn2
$$

Where:

- $Vrn_{\text{base}}$ is the baseline vernalisation expression,
- $Vrn1$ is the cold-induced vernalisation expression,
- $Vrn2$ is the photoperiod-induced repressor of flowering,
- $Vrn3$ is the photoperiod-dependent promoter of flowering.

$Vrn$ is bounded from 0 to $Vrn_{\text{max}}$.

- If vernalised:

$$
Vrn = \sum_{t = \text{imbibed}}^{\text{today}} \left( \Delta Vrn_{\text{base}} + \Delta Vrn3 \right)
$$

Delta change of $Vrn$ is calculated through the difference between the current and previous day's vernalisation level:

$$
\Delta Vrn = Vrn_{\text{today}} - Vrn_{\text{yesterday}}
$$

### Phase Transitions

The plant is

* fully vernalised  when the total vernalisation ($Vrn$) reaches a threshold of 1.0,
* transitioning to the reproductive phase when the total vernalisation ($Vrn$) reaches a threshold of 2.0.

The Haun Stage at vernalisation saturation ($HS_{VS}$) and terminal spikelet ($HS_{TS}$) are recorded from child function `HaunStage`.

### Final Leaf Number (FLN)


The Final Leaf Number is calculated at terminal spikelet following the method of @brown_integration_2013:
$$
FLN = 2.85 + 1.1 \times HS_{TS}
$$
