`EndPhase` is the final phase in a crop's phenological development. Once this phase is reached, the crop remains in this state indefinitely until it is harvested or removed.


## Overview

In the APSIM Next Gen phenology system, crop development is divided into sequential phases. `EndPhase` defines the last phase in this sequence. When the crop reaches this stage, it no longer accumulates thermal time or progresses through development.

This phase typically represents physiological maturity, senescence, or the point at which no further crop growth or development is expected. The model does not advance past this phase unless an external event (such as harvest or crop removal) occurs.

**Configurable and Reportable Properties**

| Property     | Type    | Description                                                    |
|--------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Start        | string  | Stage name marking the beginning of this phase                |
| End          | string  | Stage name marking the end of this phase (typically not used) |
| IsEmerged    | bool    | Indicates whether the crop has emerged (default: true)        |

**Read-Only Reportable Properties**

| Property           | Type    | Description                                       |
|--------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| FractionComplete   | double  | Always returns 0.0                                |
| Target             | double  | Always returns 0 (no thermal time required)       |


## Processes and Algorithms

{{< include /_includes/Models/processes-intro.md >}}

Once the crop enters the `EndPhase`, it performs no further development:

- `FractionComplete` is always 0.0, indicating the phase never progresses
- `Target` thermal time is 0, meaning no thermal time accumulation is required
- `DoTimeStep()` always returns `false`, indicating no development occurs on any timestep
- `ResetPhase()` performs no action as there is no state to reset

This phase ensures the crop's development is paused or concluded until harvest or removal.


## User Interface

`EndPhase` can be added as a child of a `Phenology` node in the model tree. Right-click the parent node, select "Add Model...", and search for `EndPhase` in the Filter Box.

### Configuration Steps

1. Right-click on a `Phenology` component in the model tree
2. Select "Add Model..."
3. Choose "EndPhase"
4. Set `Start` to the name of the stage where final development begins (e.g., "HarvestRipe")

No child models are needed for `EndPhase`.


## Practical Example

Use `EndPhase` in a crop model where development halts at a defined maturity point:

- Set `Start = "HarvestRipe"`
- Set `IsEmerged = true` (if the crop is above ground at this stage)
- The crop will remain in this phase until harvested

For example, in a wheat simulation, the EndPhase typically begins after the grain filling phase is complete, marking physiological maturity. The crop remains at this stage until the harvest operation is triggered.
