PhaseLookupValue defines a value or function that applies only within a specified phase range in a crop's development. It is used as a child of `PhaseLookup` to provide values that change according to phenological stages.

## Overview

This function enables conditional logic based on crop development stage. When the crop is between two specified stages—such as Emergence to FloralInitiation—`PhaseLookupValue` activates and returns the value of its child function. Outside this phase range, the function returns zero.

In APSIM NG, `PhaseLookupValue` is typically used under [PhaseLookup](PhaseLookup.qmd) to define phase-specific values for key processes like growth rates, stress responses, or developmental signals.

## Inputs

- Start: The name of the crop stage where this value becomes active.
- End: The name of the crop stage where this value becomes inactive.
- Child function: The first child model (e.g., constant, multiplier) providing the value when active. If multiple children are present, only the first is used.
- Phenology: The current phenological state of the crop (linked internally).

## Methodology

When simulation begins, `PhaseLookupValue` maps the `Start` and `End` crop stage names to internal indices.

Each day during the simulation:

1. It checks whether the current crop stage falls between the defined start and end stages.
2. If yes, it evaluates the first child function and returns that value.
3. If no, it returns 0.0.

Mathematically:

$$
\text{Value} = 
\begin{cases}
\text{ChildFunction}(), & \text{if in phase} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

This allows you to define rules or responses that are only active during specific crop phases.

## User Interface

`PhaseLookupValue` is used as a child of a [PhaseLookup](PhaseLookup.qmd) node. To use it:

1. Right-click on the `PhaseLookup` in the model tree.
2. Select "Add Model...".
3. Choose "PhaseLookupValue".
4. Set `Start` and `End` crop stages, and add a child function such as `Constant` or `MultiplyFunction`.


## Practical Example

Suppose you want to return a value of 1.0 during the vegetative phase and 0.5 during grain filling:

- First `PhaseLookupValue`:  
  - Start = "Emergence", End = "FloralInitiation"  
  - Child = Constant (1.0)

- Second `PhaseLookupValue`:  
  - Start = "FloralInitiation", End = "Maturity"  
  - Child = Constant (0.5)

Together, under a parent `PhaseLookup`, these values define different behavior for the crop across development.
