The `Constant` function returns a fixed value throughout the simulation. It is often used to supply a constant input (e.g., temperature threshold, fixed growth rate, photoperiod sensitivity) to other models in APSIM Next Gen.

## Overview

This function provides a simple way to input a value that does not change over time. It can be added wherever a numerical input is required and does not depend on environmental conditions, crop stage, or other simulation variables.

In APSIM NG, `Constant` is widely used as a basic building block within more complex functions, or to define cultivar-specific constants (e.g., base temperature = 0 째C, leaf width = 10 mm).

## Inputs

- `FixedValue`: The constant numerical value returned.
- `Units` (optional): The units associated with the value (e.g., 째C, mm/day).

## Methodology

This function always returns the same value, specified by the user in the `FixedValue` property. It does not depend on any conditions or crop stages.

Mathematically:
$$
\text{Value} = \text{FixedValue}
$$

It implements the `IFunction` interface, making it compatible with any APSIM component that accepts functions as inputs.

## Properties

**Configurable and Reportable Properties**

| Property     | Type    | Description                              |
|--------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| FixedValue   | double  | The constant value to return             |
| Units        | string  | Optional units associated with the value |

**Read-Only Reportable Properties**

> No read-only properties are available for this function.

## User Interface

`Constant` can be added as a child of any function-based node (e.g., `PhaseLookupValue`, `MultiplyFunction`, `AddFunction`) in the model tree. To use:

1. Right-click the parent node.
2. Select "Add Model...".
3. Search for "Constant" and select it.
4. Enter the desired numeric value and optional units.

## Practical Example

To define a base temperature of 0 째C used in a thermal time calculation:

- Add a `Constant` function under a `ThermalTime` node.
- Set `FixedValue` to `0.0`
- Set `Units` to `째C`

This constant will now serve as the threshold temperature in the growing degree-day calculation.
