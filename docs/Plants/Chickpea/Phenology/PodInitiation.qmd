The **PodInitiation** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **EndFlowering** to **EndPodInitiation**. This phase marks when pods become visible (≥1 cm) and is uniquely determined by a temperature-day counting mechanism rather than traditional thermal time accumulation [@srinivasan_cold_1998; @clarke_response_2004].

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **EndFlowering** and **EndPodInitiation** stages.

- This phase starts at **EndFlowering** and ends at **EndPodInitiation**
- The model uses a unique progression mechanism requiring 5 days of temp above 16 degrees (or ten days at 15 degrees) before 1cm pods are visible, due to sensitivity of pod initiation to mean daily temperature [@srinivasan_cold_1998; @clarke_response_2004]


## Temperature-Day Counting Mechanism

Chickpea pod development shows strong sensitivity to mean daily temperature [@srinivasan_response_1998; @clarke_growth_2004]. Visible pods (1 cm) require specific temperature conditions before they become apparent:

### Temperature Thresholds

The `PodStartTT` function counts days when mean daily temperature exceeds:
- **5 days** with mean temperature above **16°C**, OR
- **10 days** with mean temperature above **15°C**

### Cross-Phase Accumulation

A unique feature of this phase is that temperature-day counting begins at the start of flowering:

- Accumulation starts at **StartFlowering** (not at EndFlowering)
- Days meeting temperature criteria accumulate throughout the **Flowering** phase
- At **EndFlowering**, the accumulated count (`EndFloweringPodStartTT`) is recorded
- The **PodInitiation** phase target adjusts by subtracting already-accumulated days

### Target Calculation

$$
\text{Target} = 5.0 - \text{EndFloweringPodStartTT}
$$

Where:
- **5.0** = Total temperature-days required for 1 cm pods to be visible
- **EndFloweringPodStartTT** = Temperature-days accumulated from StartFlowering to EndFlowering

This means if 2 temperature-days were accumulated during flowering, only 3 more are needed during the PodInitiation phase.

## Biological Significance

This temperature-dependent mechanism reflects the physiological reality that:

1. **Pod initiation is not instantaneous**: Small pods begin forming during flowering but require time to become visible
2. **Temperature drives development**: Mean daily temperature above 15-16°C is necessary for rapid pod development
3. **Cumulative exposure matters**: The model tracks cumulative exposure to favorable temperatures
4. **Cooler temperatures delay visibility**: Under cooler conditions, more days are needed to reach the 1 cm threshold

## Pod Development Process

Once this phase is complete (1 cm pods visible):

- Pod number is largely established
- Pods continue to enlarge during subsequent grain filling phases
- Some pod abortion may still occur under stress conditions
- Assimilate demand increases as pods develop
- Early-formed pods may begin grain filling while later pods are still developing

## Environmental Sensitivity

Pod initiation timing is sensitive to:

- **Mean temperature**: Primary driver of progression through this phase
- **Temperature variability**: Cool periods slow progression of the temperature-day count
- **Water stress**: Can cause pod abortion even after pods become visible
- **Nutrient availability**: Affects pod retention and development rate

## Cultivar-Specific Parameters

| Name       | Description                                         | Default Value |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| [Phenology].PodInitiation.Target.Total | Total temperature-days required for visible pods | 5.0 |

Note: The actual target is dynamically calculated by subtracting `EndFloweringPodStartTT` from this total.

## Practical Considerations

Understanding this temperature-dependent mechanism is important for:

1. **Predicting pod set timing**: Cooler temperatures delay visible pod formation
2. **Regional differences**: Areas with warmer spring temperatures see faster pod development
3. **Sowing date effects**: Early sowing into cooler conditions extends the flowering-to-podding period
4. **Stress management**: Critical to maintain favorable conditions during this temperature accumulation
5. **Yield potential**: Timely pod formation under optimal temperatures supports higher pod numbers

The temperature-day counting approach provides a mechanistic basis for predicting when visible pods will appear across varying temperature environments, more accurately than simple thermal time would allow.
