The **FloralInitiation** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **EndJuvenille** to **StartBudding**. This phase covers the period when the plant has completed its juvenile phase and is now responsive to photoperiod as it transitions toward reproductive development.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **EndJuvenille** and **StartBudding** stages.

- This phase starts at **EndJuvenille** and ends at **StartBudding**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is influenced by cultivar-specific parameters

## Photoperiod Sensitivity

Following the juvenile phase, chickpea becomes sensitive to [Photoperiod](Photoperiod.qmd) during floral initiation. The response varies by cultivar:

- **Long-day response**: Many chickpea cultivars flower earlier under longer days
- **Day-neutral cultivars**: Some cultivars show minimal photoperiod sensitivity
- **Quantitative response**: The effect is typically quantitative rather than absolute

The photoperiod influence during this phase determines the timing of visible bud formation.
