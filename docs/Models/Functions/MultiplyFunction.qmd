The `MultiplyFunction` is a utility function that returns the **product of values** from all of its child functions.


## Overview

The `MultiplyFunction` is used to multiply multiple values for a mathematical equation. It calculates the product values of all children functions and returns the total product. This is useful when you need to combine multiple traits or parameters into a single value for further calculations in plant growth models.

## User Interface

`MultiplyFunction` can be added into the model tree by right-clicking on a parent node and selecting "Add Model...", and then search `MultiplyFunction` in the Filter Box. A symbol for the `MultiplyFunction` is displayed in the user interface to represent the function.

## Practical Example

The target thermal time from germination to emergence in the wheat model is determined by ShootLag ($ShootLag$), Sowing Depth ($SowingDepth$), and Shoot Rate ($ShootRate$).

$$
TT = ShootLag + (SowingDepth \times ShootRate)
$$

The `MultiplyFunction` is used to multiply these two values to get the total target thermal time in the equation above.
