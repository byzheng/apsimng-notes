Returns the corresponding Y value for a given X value, based on the line shape defined by the specified XY matrix.

## Overview

`XYPairs` is a fundamental function to define response curves by specifying a series of X and Y values. For a given input X, it returns a linearly interpolated value of Y based on the defined XY matrix. If outside the defined X range, it returns the first or last points of Y value at the boundary. This function is particularly useful for modeling relationships where empirical data is available, such as temperature responses or biomass partitioning in agricultural models.


## Inputs

- `X`: An array of X values defining the input domain.
- `Y`: An array of Y values corresponding to each X value. Must be the same length as `X`.

## Methodology

The `XYPairs` function performs linear interpolation between the user-defined X and Y value pairs. When the function is called with a given X value ($dX$), it locates the segment of the curve that contains the input and linearly interpolates to determine the corresponding Y value. If outside the defined X range, it returns the Y value at the nearest boundary point (either the first or last Y value).

The interpolation follows this equation between points $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1})$:

$$
Y = y_i + \frac{(dX - x_i)}{(x_{i+1} - x_i)} (y_{i+1} - y_i)
$$

## User Interface

`XYPairs` can be added as a child of any functional models in the model tree. Right-click the parent node, select "Add Model...", and search for `XYPairs` in the Filter Box.

## Practical Example

Suppose you want to define a response curve for a process that increases linearly with thermal time up to a maximum, then decreases. Set:

- `X = [0, 26, 34]`
- `Y = [0, 26, 0]`

This means:
- For thermal time (`X`) less than 0, the response (`Y`) is 0.
- From 0 to 26, the response increases linearly from 0 to 26.
- From 26 to 34, the response decreases linearly from 26 to 0.
- For thermal time greater than 34, the response remains 0.

```{r plot-xypairs, fig.height = 4, fig.cap="Example of XYPairs Function"}
# Define X and Y values
X <- c(0, 26, 34)
Y <- c(0, 26, 0)

# Generate a sequence of X values for smooth plotting
x_seq <- seq(min(X) - 5, max(X) + 5, length.out = 200)

# Linear interpolation using approx
y_interp <- approx(X, Y, xout = x_seq, rule = 2)$y

library(ggplot2)

# Create a data frame for plotting
df <- data.frame(x = x_seq, y = y_interp)

# Plot using ggplot2
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
    geom_point(data = data.frame(x = X, y = Y), aes(x = x, y = y), color = "red", size = 2) +
    labs(x = "Temperature (°C)", y = "Thermal time (°Cd)") +
    theme_minimal()
```
