The APSIM Canola model is constructed using the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) [@brown_plant_2014], which offers a modular library of plant organ and process submodels. This design allows for dynamic assembly of complex crop models, such as canola, by integrating components like photosynthesis and leaf development without additional coding.
