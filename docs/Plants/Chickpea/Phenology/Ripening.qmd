The **Ripening** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **Maturity** to **HarvestRipe**. This phase covers the final drying period when seeds reach optimal moisture content for harvest.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **Maturity** and **HarvestRipe** stages.

- This phase starts at **Maturity** and ends at **HarvestRipe**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Ripening Process

During the ripening phase:

- Seeds continue to lose moisture
- Seed moisture content approaches harvest moisture (typically 12-15%)
- Plant is fully senesced and dry
- Pods are brown and brittle
- Seeds have hardened seed coats

## Cultivar-Specific Parameters

| Name       | Description                                         | Default Value |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| [Phenology].Ripening.Target   | Thermal time for ripening (°Cd) | 60 |
