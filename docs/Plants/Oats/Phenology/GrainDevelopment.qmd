The GrainDevelopment phase represents the early period of grain development following flowering in oats.

## Phase Type

[GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd)

## Timing

- **Start**: Flowering
- **End**: StartGrainFill
- **IsEmerged**: true

## Description

The GrainDevelopment phase is a short period immediately after flowering during which fertilised ovules begin to develop into grains. This phase represents the lag phase before active grain filling begins.

## Thermal Time Target

The target thermal time for this phase is a fixed value:

$$
\text{Target} = 20 \text{°Cd}
$$

## Progression

The phase progresses based on daily [ThermalTime](ThermalTime.qmd) accumulation.

## Parameters

- **Target**: 20.0°Cd
