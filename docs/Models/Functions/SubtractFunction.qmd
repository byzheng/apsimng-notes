The `SubtractFunction` is a utility function that returns the difference of values from its child functions.


## Overview

The `SubtractFunction` is used to subtract the values of other child functions from the first child. It calculates the difference between the first child function and the sum of all subsequent child functions. This is useful when you need to compute a value that is derived from subtracting multiple traits or parameters in plant growth models.

## User Interface

`SubtractFunction` can be added into the model tree by right-clicking on a parent node and selecting "Add Model...", and then search `SubtractFunction` in the Filter Box. A symbol for the `SubtractFunction` is displayed in the user interface to represent the function.

## Practical Example

The wheat yield is reduced by frost stress as a ratio of total yield (e.g. `FrostDamage`). The final yield is calculated by subtracting the frost damage from the total potential yield.

$$
FinalYield = TotalPotentialYield \times (1 - FrostDamage)
$$

The `SubtractFunction` is used to subtract these two values to get the final yield in the equation above.
