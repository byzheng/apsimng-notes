The **Flowering** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **StartFlowering** to **EndFlowering**. This phase covers the active flowering period when flowers open, pollination occurs, and pod initiation begins.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **StartFlowering** and **EndFlowering** stages.

- This phase starts at **StartFlowering** and ends at **EndFlowering**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Flowering Characteristics

Chickpea has an indeterminate flowering habit:

- Flowers appear sequentially at nodes on the main stem and branches
- Flowering typically extends over several weeks
- Lower nodes flower first, followed by upper nodes
- Pod development begins while flowering continues at upper nodes
- The flowering period varies with cultivar and environmental conditions
