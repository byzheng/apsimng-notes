<div class="intro-text">
This section lists the key variables that describe or control the behaviour of this component. Some variables can be adjusted by the user to modify how the model behaves (configurable), while others are calculated internally and can be viewed as model outputs (reportable). For a general explanation of variable types and how they are used within the APSIM Next Generation framework, see the [Model Variables Overview](/docs/Models/Variables.qmd).
