title: "Symbol Glossary"
format: html

This document provides a centralized glossary of mathematical symbols used throughout the APSIM NG documentation.  
To ensure clarity and avoid confusion between similarly named concepts (e.g. **Phyllochron** and **Photoperiod**), we adopt a consistent convention of using **two-letter symbols** wherever possible.

Symbols are grouped by functional categories such as **Phenology**, **Climate**, **Soil Water**, and **General Simulation Variables** to reflect their use across the APSIM NG framework.

## General Conventions

- Symbols are written in *italic*, e.g. $TT$
- Symbols use **two-letter abbreviations** to distinguish overlapping concepts (e.g. $Ph$ for phyllochron, $PP$ for photoperiod)
- Subscripts clarify properties or context, e.g. $T_{\text{max}}$, $Ph_{\text{base}}$
- Greek letters represent parameters or coefficients, e.g. $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\Delta$
- Units are expressed in SI unless otherwise noted


## ðŸŒ± Phenology

| Symbol         | Name                          | Units    | Description                                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| $TT$           | Daily Thermal time                   | Â°Cd      | Daily thermal time accumulated                          |
| $Ph$           | Phyllochron                   | Â°Cd      | Thermal time required for the appearance of successive leaves on the main stem |
| $HS$           | Haun Stage                    | -        | Number of fully expanded leaves on the main stem [@haun_visual_1973]         |
| $Ph_{\text{base}}$ | Base phyllochron           | Â°Cd      | Base phyllochron for most of leaves                 |



## Notes

- Symbols may appear in multiple modules but should retain their meaning consistently.
- This glossary will evolve as APSIM NG continues to grow â€” contributions welcome.
