  abstract = {The Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) is a software framework for creating models that represent the plant components of farm system models in the agricultural production system simulator (APSIM). It is the next step in the evolution of generic crop templates for APSIM, building on software and science lessons from past versions and capitalising on new software approaches. The PMF contains a top-level Plant class that provides an interface with the APSIM model environment and controls the other classes in the plant model. Other classes include mid-level Organ, Phenology, Structure and Arbitrator classes that represent specific elements or processes of the crop and sub-classes that the mid-level classes use to represent repeated data structures. It also contains low-level Function classes which represent generic mathematical, logical, procedural or reference code and provide values to the processes carried out by mid-level classes. A plant configuration file specifies which mid-level and Function classes are to be included and how they are to be arranged and parameterised to represent a particular crop model. The PMF has an integrated design environment to allow plant models to be created visually. The aims of the PMF are to maximise code reuse and allow flexibility in the structure of models. Four examples are included to demonstrate the flexibility of application of the PMF; 1. Slurp, a simple model of the water use of a static crop, 2. Oat, an annual grain crop model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 3. Lucerne, perennial forage model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 4. Wheat, another detailed annual crop model constructed using an alternative set of organ and process classes. These examples show the PMF can be used to develop models of different complexities and allows flexibility in the approach for implementing crop physiology concepts into model set up.},

  abstract = {Eucalyptus-breeding efforts have been made to identify clones of superior performance for growth and yield and how they will interact with global climate changes. This study performs a global sensitivity analysis for assessing the impact of genetic traits on Eucalyptus yield across contrasting environments in Brazil under present and future climate scenarios. The APSIM Next Generation Eucalyptus model was used to perform the simulations of stemwood biomass (t ha−1) for 7-year rotations across 23 locations in Brazil. Projections for the period from 2020 to 2049 using three global circulation models under intermediate (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios were performed. The Morris sensitivity method was used to perform a global sensitivity analysis to identify the influence of plant traits on stemwood biomass. Traits for radiation use efficiency, leaf partitioning, canopy light capture and fine root partitioning were the most important, impacting the Eucalyptus yield substantially in all environments under the present climate. Some of the traits targeted now by breeders for current climate will remain important under future climates. However, breeding should place a greater emphasis on photosynthetic temperature response for Eucalyptus in some regions. Global sensitivity analysis was found to be a powerful tool for identifying suitable Eucalyptus traits for adaptation to climate variability and change. This approach can improve breeding strategies by better understanding the gene × environment interactions for forest productivity.},

  abstract = {Daily totals or daily averages are convenient to work with and provide a first sound impression of the climatic factors. For example, the development rate of a crop can be estimated quite well by making use of the average air temperature. After all, it is not possible to measure accurately the stages of development from day to day, which means that the effect of temperature must be integrated over at least a week. It is then usual to make use of the concept of ‘temperature sum’ or ‘degree-days’. This value is calculated as the integral of the value with which the (average) temperature exceeds a certain lower threshold (e.g. 5 °C), below which no development occurs at all. This procedure implicitly assumes a linear response above the lower threshold. Also the sum of radiation (possibly modified by the fraction intercepted, see Eqn 2.7) is often used.},
