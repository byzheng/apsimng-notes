The **GrainRipening** phase in [Wheat](/docs/Plants/Wheat) represents the developmental period from **EndGrainFill** to **HarvestRipe**. It is influenced by thermal time only.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between the `EndGrainFill` and `HarvestRipe` stages.

- This phase starts at **EndGrainFill** and ends at **HarvestRipe**, when the grain is considered to be fully ripe.
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function.
- The **Target thermal time** is fixed as constant for this phase, with default value of 335.0 °Cd.
