A data structure that stores cultivar-specific vernalisation rate parameters in APSIM Next Generation. These parameters define how vernalisation genes (Vrn1, Vrn2, Vrn3) respond to temperature and photoperiod cues during cereal development, enabling genotype-specific simulation of flowering time.

## Overview

The `CultivarRateParams` class is a parameter container that holds vernalisation-related coefficients for a specific genotype or cultivar. These values quantify the rates and thresholds for vernalisation gene expression under different photothermal conditions, including baseline expression rates, cold-induced upregulation, and photoperiod sensitivity.

This class is not a computational model itself but serves as a data structure populated by the [CalcCAMPVrnRates](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/CAMP/CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) function based on controlled environment final leaf number (FLN) observations. The parameters are then used by the [CAMP](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/CAMP/CAMP.qmd) model to simulate genotype × environment interactions that influence flowering time in cereals such as wheat and barley.

## Model Variables

**Configurable and Reportable Properties**

The following parameters represent physiological and regulatory coefficients used to simulate flowering development:

- `BaseDVrnVeg` ($\Delta V_{\text{base, veg}}$): Baseline rate of vernalisation gene expression (Vrn1) in the vegetative phase at high temperatures (e.g., >20°C).
- `MaxDVrnVeg` ($\Delta V_{\text{max, veg}}$): Maximum upregulation of Vrn1 under cold conditions (e.g., 0°C).
- `BaseDVrnER` ($\Delta V_{\text{base, ER}}$): Baseline rate of Vrn1 expression during early reproductive phase without photoperiod upregulation.
- `MaxDVrnER` ($\Delta V_{\text{max, ER}}$): Maximum rate of Vrn1 expression during early reproductive phase under long photoperiod.
- `PpVrn3FactVeg` ($F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, veg}}$): Enhancement factor for Vrn1 expression in vegetative phase due to Vrn3 upregulation under long days.
- `PpVrn3FactER` ($F_{\text{Pp, Vrn3, ER}}$): Enhancement factor for Vrn1 expression in early reproductive phase due to Vrn3 under long days.
- `MaxVrn2` ($V_{\text{max, Vrn2}}$): Maximum Vrn2 expression level under long photoperiods, which must be suppressed before full Vrn1 expression can proceed.
- `MethalationThreshold` ($M_{\text{threshold}}$): Threshold level of cold-induced Vrn1 expression needed to enable persistent Vrn1 activation (methalation).
- `ColdVrn1Fact` ($C_{\text{Vrn1}}$): Factor by which cold temperatures increase the rate of Vrn1 expression compared to the baseline.

These parameters are essential for simulating genotype × environment interactions that influence time to floral initiation and flowering in cereal crops.

## User Interface

This data structure is not directly user-configurable through the UI. It is populated automatically by the [CalcCAMPVrnRates](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/CAMP/CalcCAMPVrnRates.qmd) function based on genotype-specific FLN observations and controlled environment data.

## Practical Example

> No practical example is available for this model.
