The **EarlyGrainFilling** phase in [Chickpea](/docs/Plants/Chickpea) represents the developmental period from **EndPodInitiation** to **MidGrainFilling**. This phase marks the beginning of the grain filling period when seeds start to accumulate dry matter rapidly.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between **EndPodInitiation** and **MidGrainFilling** stages.

- This phase starts at **EndPodInitiation** and ends at **MidGrainFilling**
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function
- The **Target thermal time** is cultivar-specific

## Early Grain Filling Process

During early grain filling:

- Seeds begin rapid accumulation of starch, protein, and other reserves
- Grain filling rate is typically highest during this phase
- Seeds increase in size and weight substantially
- Assimilate demand by grains is very high
- Source-sink relationships strongly influence grain growth

## Assimilate Sources

Grain growth during this phase is supported by:

- **Current photosynthesis**: From leaves and green pods
- **Stem reserves**: Mobilization of stored carbohydrates
- **Nitrogen remobilization**: From vegetative organs to grains

## Cultivar-Specific Parameters

| Name       | Description                                         | Default Value |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| [Phenology].EarlyGrainFilling.Target   | Thermal time for early grain filling (°Cd) | Cultivar-specific |

## Environmental Sensitivity

Early grain filling is sensitive to:

1. **Water stress**: Deficit reduces grain filling rate and final seed size
2. **Heat stress**: High temperatures (>35°C) can reduce grain filling duration and rate
3. **Radiation**: Cloud cover or low light reduces photosynthetic supply
4. **Nitrogen availability**: Affects protein accumulation in seeds

## Practical Considerations

Management during early grain filling should focus on:

- Maintaining adequate soil moisture to support high grain filling rates
- Avoiding heat stress during this critical period
- Ensuring sufficient nitrogen for protein accumulation
- Protecting leaf area from diseases or pests to maintain photosynthetic capacity

Optimal conditions during early grain filling are crucial for achieving maximum seed size and yield in chickpea.
