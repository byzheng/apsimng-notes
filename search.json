    "section": "Explanation",
    "text": "Explanation\nThe Weather model in APSIM contains a CO2 property, which determines the atmospheric CO₂ concentration used in crop growth and development calculations. This property is normally updated with each day’s weather data.\nBy subscribing to the PreparingNewWeatherData event, the script intercepts the process before daily weather values are applied. This allows you to override the CO₂ value dynamically for the duration of the simulation.\nThis approach is particularly useful for experiments involving elevated CO₂ or simulating long-term climate change effects where static weather files are used but require changes in CO₂ independently."

    "text": "Overview\nThe Phyllochron model simulates the interval between the appearance of successive leaf tips on a wheat plant. It acts like a biological clock, helping researchers and agronomists predict how fast a plant will grow new leaves under different conditions. This model is a key part of the crop’s phenology (developmental timing), which is crucial for understanding when the plant will reach important stages like flowering and grain filling.\nLeaf appearance rate is influenced by temperature (how warm it is), the plant’s stage of development (which leaf is appearing), and the length of the day (photoperiod). By adjusting these parameters, the model can represent different wheat varieties and growing environments. This helps breeders and agronomists select varieties that are better suited to specific climates or management practices.",

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nThe Phyllochron model is based on the idea that the time between new leaf appearances (measured in degree-days, or °C·days) is not constant. Instead, it changes depending on the leaf’s position on the plant and the day length.\nThe effective phyllochron (\\(P_{\\text{eff}}\\)) is calculated as:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{eff}} = P_{\\text{base}} \\times f_{\\text{leaf}}(n) \\times f_{\\text{pp}}(d)\n\\]\n\n\\(P_{\\text{base}}\\) is the base phyllochron (default: 120 °C·days), representing the typical interval between leaves under standard conditions for leaf rank from 3 to 7.\n\\(f_{\\text{leaf}}(n)\\) is a factor that adjusts the phyllochron depending on which leaf is appearing (\\(n\\) is the leaf cohort number).\n\\(f_{\\text{pp}}(d)\\) is a modifier that accounts for the effect of day length (\\(d\\) is the photoperiod in hours).\n\n\nLeaf Stage Factor\nThe rate at which new leaves appear changes as the plant grows. Early leaves appear faster, while later leaves take longer (Jamieson et al. 1998). This is represented by a piecewise function:\n\n\n\nLeaf Cohort Number (\\(n\\))\nFactor\n\n\n\n\n0–2\n0.75\n\n\n3–7\n1.0\n\n\n8+\n1.4\n\n\n\nThis means the first 2 leaves appear more quickly, leaves in the middle appear at a standard rate, and later leaves appear more slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaf Stage Factor as a Function of Leaf Cohort Number\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoperiod Effect\nThe model also accounts for how sensitive the plant is to day length with 6 degrees twilight. When days are short (less than 12 hours), leaf appearance slows down. The photoperiod effect is calculated as:\n\\[\nf_{\\text{pp}}(d) = 1 + S \\cdot f_d(d)\n\\]\n\n\\(S\\) is the photoperiod sensitivity (a parameter that can be adjusted for different varieties). \\(S\\) is typically set to 0.6 for wheat, which means the phyllochron increases by 60% (i.e. \\(120 \\times (1 + 0.6) = 192\\) °C·days) when day length is less than 8 hours, and not at all (i.e. \\(120 \\times (1 + 0) = 120\\) °C·days) when it is above 12 hours.\n\\(f_d(d)\\) describes how the effect changes with day length:\n\n\n\n\nDay Length (h)\nModifier \\(f_d(d)\\)\n\n\n\n\n8\n1.0\n\n\n12\n0.0\n\n\n20\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoperiod Effect on Phyllochron\n\n\n\n\nSo, for day lengths below 12 hours, the phyllochron increases (leaves appear more slowly), but above 12 hours, there is no further effect.",

    "section": "Methodology",
    "text": "Methodology\nThe Haun Stage is based on the biological principle that leaves appear at regular intervals, determined by temperature. Each day, the model calculates how much “thermal time” (accumulated heat) the plant has experienced. When enough thermal time has passed, a new leaf tip appears.\nThe daily increase in Haun Stage is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\Delta \\text{HS} = \\frac{\\text{TT}}{\\text{Ph}}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\text{TT}\\) is the amount of heat accumulated in a day (measured in degree-days).\n\\(\\text{Ph}\\) is the amount of thermal time needed for each new leaf to appear.\n\nThe model sums these daily increments from emergence until the flag leaf appears, for example, a Haun Stage of 5.3 means five leaves are fully visible and the sixth is partly emerged (30%).\nKey assumptions:\n\nLeaf appearance is driven mainly by temperature.\nEach variety has its own characteristic phyllochron.\nThe process is continuous, not stepwise, allowing for partial leaves.\n\nThis approach is supported by research showing that leaf appearance in cereals follows a predictable thermal pattern (Haun 1973).",

    "section": "Practical Example",
    "text": "Practical Example\nSuppose a researcher wants to estimate when the flag leaf will appear in different wheat varieties. They set the phyllochron for each variety based on field data. For example, if a variety has a phyllochron of 120 °Cd and one day records 24 °Cd of thermal time:\n\\[\n\\Delta \\text{HaunStage} = \\frac{24}{120} = 0.2\n\\]\nAfter five days at this rate, the Haun Stage increases by 1.0, meaning one new leaf tip has appeared. By tracking Haun Stage over time, researchers can compare development rates between varieties or under different treatments, supporting breeding and agronomic decisions. The Haun Stage model tracks the number of leaf tips that have appeared on a cereal plant since emergence. It provides a continuous measure of crop development and is critical for predicting phenological stages and leaf-related processes.",

It represents the effective temperature for plant development above a base temperature.\nPlacement in crop system: Thermal time is calculated daily within the Phenology component and serves as the fundamental progression driver for all phenological phases (Germinating, Emerging, Vegetative, Reproductive, Grain Filling) and many organ growth processes.\nImportance for agronomy or breeding: Thermal time allows prediction of crop development stages under varying temperature regimes, enabling better crop management decisions (sowing dates, irrigation timing, harvest scheduling) and breeding selection for different thermal environments.\nEnvironmental sensitivities:\n\nTemperature: Primary driver - responds to air temperature with three cardinal temperatures defining the response curve\nDiurnal temperature variation: Captured through sub-daily interpolation to account for temperature fluctuations throughout the day with three-hourly interpolation method",

Air temperature is interpolated from daily maximum and minimum using the three-hourly air temperature interpolation method, and the thermal time response is applied at each three-hour interval, then aggregated to give the daily total:\n\\[\nTT_{\\text{daily}} = \\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{i=1}^{8} TT_{t}(T_{i})\n\\]\nwhere \\(T_i\\) represents the interpolated temperature at each three-hour interval.",

The permanent wilting point - the volumetric water content below which plants cannot extract water. Measured at 1500 kPa suction.\n\n\nParticleSizeClay\ndouble[]\nClay fraction (0-1 or %). Particles smaller than 0.002 mm. Clay content strongly influences water retention, cation exchange capacity, and hydraulic conductivity.\n\n\nParticleSizeSand\ndouble[]\nSand fraction (0-1 or %). Particles between 0.02-2 mm. Sand content affects soil drainage, aeration, and workability.\n\n\nParticleSizeSilt\ndouble[]\nSilt fraction (0-1 or %). Particles between 0.002-0.02 mm. Silt influences water retention and soil structure.\n\n\nRocks\ndouble[]\nRock fragment content (% by volume). The proportion of the soil volume occupied by particles larger than 2 mm, which reduces the effective soil volume for water storage and root growth.\n\n\nSAT\ndouble[]\nSaturation water content (mm/mm). The volumetric water content when all pore space is filled with water. This is the maximum water storage capacity of the soil.\n\n\n\nRead-Only Reportable Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nDULmm\ndouble[]\nDrained upper limit in mm of water per layer.

This calculation accounts for the “droopy leaf” method where visible leaf tips are one fewer than fully developed leaves.\n\n\nStem Extension and Node Development (BBCH 30-39)\nWhen the plant enters the LeafAppearance phase and appeared leaf cohort number is less than final leaf number, the BBCH transitions to stem extension stages:\n\\[\n\\text{BBCH} = 30 + \\min(9, N_{\\text{expanded}} - N_{\\text{initial}})\n\\]\nwhere \\(N_{\\text{expanded}}\\) is the current number of expanded leaf cohorts and \\(N_{\\text{initial}}\\) is the number of expanded cohorts at the start of stem extension. The model assumes node appearance occurs at the same rate as leaf appearance.\n\n\nInflorescence Development (BBCH 50-59)\nBBCH stage 50 occurs when the tassel becomes visible, which corresponds to the appearance of the flag leaf tip. During flag leaf expansion within the LeafAppearance phase after the final leaf has appeared:\n\\[\n\\text{BBCH} = 50 + 5 \\times \\frac{F_{\\text{current}} - F_{\\text{BBCH50}}}{1 - F_{\\text{BBCH50}}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(F_{\\text{current}}\\) is the current fraction through the LeafAppearance phase and \\(F_{\\text{BBCH50}}\\) is the fraction when BBCH 50 was reached. This assumes the tassel will be half emerged when the flag leaf is fully expanded.\n\n\nReproductive Development (BBCH 55-99)\nLater stages use linear interpolation between key phenological milestones:\nThe mapping between APSIM-NG stages and BBCH codes is:\n\n\n\nAPSIM Stage\nAPSIM Name\nBBCH Code\nBBCH Description\n\n\n\n\n6.0\nFlagLeafFullyExpanded\n55\nMid-tassel emergence\n\n\n7.0\nFlowering\n65\nMid-flowering\n\n\n8.0\nStartGrainFill\n70\nBeginning of grain development\n\n\n9.0\nEndGrainFill\n87\nPhysiological maturity\n\n\n10.0\nMaturity\n99\nHarvest product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: APSIM to Zadok Growth Stage Mapping",

It is a simplified approach to tracking phenological development in crops, where the phase completes when the current number of leaves reaches the target leaf number. This phase is particularly useful for crops where leaf appearance is a key developmental milestone, such as cereals and grasses.\nThe phase progresses from a specified Start stage to a specified End stage. The duration is controlled by the difference between the target leaf number and the current leaf number. Once initialized, the target for completion is fixed based on the initial leaf count, meaning subsequent changes to the final leaf number do not affect when this phase will complete.",

The interface allows other components within APSIM to query vernalisation status without needing to understand the internal mechanics of gene expression calculations.\nThe interface supports mechanistic modelling of genotype × environment interactions by providing access to:\n\nIndividual vernalisation gene expression levels (Vrn1, Vrn2, Vrn3)\nBaseline and maximum expression rates\nBoolean flags indicating completion of key developmental phases\n\nThis abstraction enables flexible coupling between phenology models and other plant components, supporting both detailed mechanistic models and simpler empirical approaches within the same framework.",

It is upregulated by cold temperatures and, once methalated, provides a persistent “memory” of vernalisation. In the CAMP model, Vrn1 expression must reach a threshold (typically 1.0) for the plant to complete the vernalisation phase. Base expression occurs at warm temperatures, but cold exposure accelerates this process significantly.\nVrn2: This gene acts as a flowering repressor that is upregulated under long photoperiods. It effectively raises the threshold that Vrn1 must overcome before vernalisation is complete. Short photoperiods suppress Vrn2 expression, allowing “short-day vernalisation” where plants can complete vernalisation requirements more quickly under short days.\nVrn3: A photoperiod-responsive gene that promotes flowering. It is upregulated under long photoperiods and accelerates progress toward reproductive transition. Vrn3 expression increases after Vrn1 has sufficiently suppressed Vrn2, representing the plant’s readiness to initiate reproductive development.\nBaseVrn: Represents the baseline accumulation of vernalisation signal that occurs even under warm temperatures. This parameter varies by genotype - vernalisation-insensitive varieties have higher base rates and can complete development quickly without cold exposure, while vernalisation-sensitive varieties have lower base rates and require cold to accelerate development.\nMaxVrn: The maximum rate at which vernalisation can accumulate, typically achieved under optimal conditions (cold temperatures during vernalisation, long photoperiods during reproductive transition). This provides an upper bound on developmental rate.\nIsVernalised: A boolean flag indicating whether the plant has completed vernalisation requirements. This transition occurs when total vernalisation signal (typically \\(BaseVrn + Vrn1 + Vrn3 - Vrn2\\)) exceeds a threshold value (typically 1.0). This flag triggers important developmental transitions in phenology models.",

This represents the cold-induced acceleration of vernalisation that allows plants to progress through their vernalisation requirement more rapidly under chilling conditions.\nThe function uses a temperature-dependent exponential response where Vrn1 expression increases as temperatures decline below optimal growing conditions. When temperatures exceed a de-vernalisation threshold, the response is reduced or suppressed to mimic the loss of vernalisation memory at warm temperatures. This mechanism is essential for accurately modeling development timing in cold-requiring cultivars across varying thermal environments.\nThe function implements both IFunction and IIndexedFunction interfaces and operates within the CAMP phenology framework.",

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nThe CAMP model (Brown et al. 2013) is based on Kirby (1988)’s framework, which assumes that the timing of anthesis results from the timing of flag leaf appearance plus an additional thermal time period from flag leaf to heading and anthesis. The timing of flag leaf appearance is determined by the Final Leaf Number (FLN), which sets a developmental target, and the leaf appearance rate, which determines the rate of progress toward that target. Leaf appearance rate is a function of thermal time and a genotype-specific phyllochron that varies with Haun stage as described by Jamieson et al. (1998).\nThe CAMP model simulates molecular responses to temperature and photoperiod signals that regulate flowering transitions, including upregulation of Vrn1, Vrn2, and Vrn3 genes. These genes regulate the timing of key developmental transitions, particularly the completion of vernalisation and initiation of the reproductive phase.\nProgress through the vernalising phase is determined by the apparent expression of Vrn1 and Vrn2 genes: Vrn1 is the gene that orchestrates cold temperature responses in development. To complete the vernalising stage, Vrn1 expression must first reach a threshold of at least 1.0. In warm temperatures (above 18 °C), Vrn1 is expressed at a genotype-dependent base rate. This base rate is lower for vernalisation-sensitive genotypes, which develop slower under warm conditions. However, exposure to cold temperatures accelerates Vrn1 expression, causing vernalisation-sensitive varieties to reach this stage at a lower Haun stage.\nVrn2 is upregulated by longer photoperiods and acts as a repressor of Vrn3, which is essential for progression to spikelet initiation. Vrn1 in turn represses Vrn2. Thus, higher photoperiod-induced Vrn2 expression raises the Vrn1 target above 1.0, extending the vernalisation phase. Conversely, shorter days reduce the Vrn1 target, a phenomenon known as short-day vernalisation. Vrn3 may also contribute to the acceleration of Vrn1 expression during vernalisation, a process represented by a composite parameter VrnX in the CAMP model.\nThe CAMP model integrates molecular and physiological representations to better capture genotype × environment × management (G×E×M) interactions and to provide a mechanistic bridge between genetic parameters and field-level crop behavior. All gene expressions are derived daily based on Haun stage increment, temperature, and photoperiod.\n\nGenetic Control of Phenology\nThree groups of genes are involved in cereal phenology:\n\nVernalisation genes (VRN): These genes promote flowering in response to prolonged exposure to cold temperatures.\nPhotoperiod sensitivity genes (PPD): These genes regulate flowering time based on day length.\nEarliness per se genes (EPS): These genes control the rate of development independently of environmental cues.\n\nFour treatments are used to represent the major gene effects on phenology (Bloomfield et al. 2023; Zheng et al. 2013):\n\n\n\nTreatment\nDescription\nVRN\nPPD\nEPS\n\n\n\n\nLV\nLong photoperiod with vernalisation\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n\nLN\nLong photoperiod without vernalisation\n✗\n✓\n✓\n\n\nSV\nShort photoperiod with vernalisation\n✓\n✗\n✓\n\n\nSN\nShort photoperiod without vernalisation\n✗\n✗\n✓\n\n\n\nVernalisation genes are activated by exposure to low temperatures following seed germination.",

Where appropriate, equations or conceptual summaries are provided to explain how the process operates within the APSIM Next Generation framework.\n\n\nParameterisation\nGenotype-specific rates of gene expression in CAMP are defined by FLNparams, which includes:\n\nMinLN: Base final leaf number under full vernalisation and long photoperiod.\nPpLN: Increase in FLN when grown under short photoperiod (e.g. 8h) after full vernalisation.\nVrnLN: Increase in FLN due to lack of vernalisation when grown under short photoperiod.\nVxPLN: Modification to FLN due to photoperiod interaction under unvernalised conditions.\n\nControlled environment conditions under which final leaf number (FinalLeafNumberSet) was observed and defined by EnvData:\n\nVrnTreatTemp: Temperature (°C) used during the vernalisation treatment.\nVrnTreatDuration: Number of days the plants were exposed to the vernalising temperature.\nTreatmentPp_L: Photoperiod (hours) during the long-day photoperiod treatment.\nTtEmerge: Measured thermal time (°Cd) from sowing to emergence.\n\n\n\nOn Plant Sowing\nWhen the plant is sown, the CAMP model\n\nresets all vernalisation gene expressions,\ncalculates vernalisation rate parameters using a set of final leaf number parameters and controlled environment data.\n\n\n\nOn Seed Imbibed\nWhen the seed is imbibed after germination, the CAMP model set isImbibed to true, indicating that the seed has absorbed water and is ready for germination.\n\n\nON Plant Emerged\nWhen the plant emerges, the CAMP model set IsEmerged to true, indicating that the plant has successfully emerged from the soil.\n\n\nOn Pre Phenology\nIn each day before phenology calculations, the CAMP model updates the expression of Vrn1, Vrn2, and Vrn3 based on current Haun stage, temperature, and photoperiod. The rate of gene expression is genotype-specific and internally derived from FLN parameters.\n\nVrn1 is expressed at a base rate under warm conditions, increasing under colder temperatures. The total expression includes both base and cold-driven components. Once Vrn1 expression exceeds the threshold of 1.0, the plant is considered vernalised.\nVrn2 is upregulated by long photoperiods. It inhibits Vrn3 expression and must be repressed (via increased Vrn1) before reproductive development can proceed.\nVrn3 is upregulated after vernalisation is complete and is necessary for terminal spikelet initiation. Its expression accelerates phenological progression.\n\nThe following steps are performed on event PrePhenology:\n\nCalculate daily Haun Stage changes\nWhether the crop has emerged is determined by whether the current phase represents development above the soil surface — that is, the phase itself occurs above ground or comes after emergence in most plants.\nIf the crop has not emerged, the Haun Stage delta (\\(\\Delta HS\\)) is estimated based on daily thermal time (\\(TT\\)) and a base phyllochron:\n\\[\n\\Delta HS = \\frac{TT}{Ph_\\text{base}} \\times F_{\\text{emgDur}}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(Ph_\\text{base}\\) is the base phyllochron (thermal time per leaf appearance) for the crop, is a factor that slows down leaf appearance\n\\(F_{\\text{emgDur}}\\) is a factor that accounts for the duration of emergence, which is set to 1.0 if the accumulated thermal time since sowing does not exceed 90°C·d.\n\nIf the accumulated thermal time since sowing exceeds 90°C·d, a correction factor is applied to account for prolonged or delayed emergence conditions:\n\\[\nF_{\\text{emgDur}} = e^{-0.015 \\times ( \\sum_{t = t_{\\text{sow}}}^{t_{\\text{today}}} TT_t - 90)}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\sum_{t = \\text{sow}}^{\\text{today}} TT_t\\) is the cumulative thermal time from sowing to today.\n\nIf the crop has emerged, \\(\\Delta HS\\) is calculated from the model input variable deltaHaunStage.

This method is part of the broader plant allocation system and is invoked by arbitrator components such as BiomassTypeArbitrator.\nArbitration is performed in two passes for each of the supply sources. On the first pass, biomass or nutrient supply is allocated to structural and metabolic pools of each organ based on their demand relative to the demand from all organs. On the second pass, any remaining supply is allocated to non-structural (storage) pools based on the organ’s relative demand.\n\nBiological Motivation\nPlants must allocate available assimilates or nutrients among organs in a coordinated way. The RelativeAllocation method mimics this by:\n\nPrioritizing structural and metabolic demands (essential growth),\nThen allocating any residual supply to storage pools (non-essential, luxury uptake).\n\nThis reflects physiological prioritization in plant growth where essential structural and metabolic needs are met before luxury storage.",

The algorithm iterates through each child function, comparing their returned values:\n\\[\nValue_{min} = \\min(F_1, F_2, F_3, \\ldots, F_n)\n\\]\nwhere \\(F_i\\) represents the value returned by the \\(i\\)-th child function, and \\(n\\) is the total number of child functions.\nThe implementation initializes the return value to a very large number (999,999,999) and then compares each child function’s value, retaining the minimum:\n\\[\nValue_{return} = \\begin{cases}\n999999999 & \\text{initially} \\\\\n\\min(Value_{return}, F_i) & \\text{for each child } i\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis approach ensures that even if all child functions return large values, the smallest among them is selected. If no child functions are present, the function returns the initial large value.",

Rather than writing manager scripts, users can configure biomass removal actions through a user interface, specifying dates, removal types, and fractions of live and dead biomass to remove from specific plant organs.\nThe model is designed to simulate common agricultural practices such as:\n\nCutting: Removing biomass from forage crops or pastures\nGrazing: Simulating animal consumption of plant material\nHarvesting: Removing grain, fruit, or other harvestable organs\nPruning: Removing branches, shoots, or other structural components\nEnd of Crop: Complete biomass removal at crop termination\n\nFor each removal event, users can specify what fraction of live and dead biomass should be removed entirely versus transferred to the soil surface residue pool. This granular control enables realistic simulation of different management practices and their impacts on nutrient cycling and soil organic matter.",

The FrostHeatDamageFunctions model quantifies this impact by:\n\nAssessing potential damage based on how extreme the temperature is relative to crop-specific thresholds\nAdjusting for developmental sensitivity recognizing that crops are more vulnerable at certain growth stages (e.g., anthesis)\nTracking cumulative effects as multiple stress events have multiplicative rather than additive impacts on yield\n\nThis function operates independently of the main yield prediction algorithms, calculating damage ratios (0–1, where 0 = no damage, 1 = complete yield loss) that can be applied to potential yield estimates. The model runs daily during the crop lifecycle, continuously monitoring temperature conditions and growth stage progression.\nKey Applications: - Predicting frost-induced yield losses in wheat and canola - Assessing heat stress impacts during reproductive development - Evaluating combined frost and heat risks across growing seasons - Supporting agronomic decisions about variety selection and sowing dates\nBiological Basis: Frost damage primarily affects reproductive organs through ice crystal formation, cell membrane disruption, and metabolic dysfunction. Heat stress impairs pollen viability, disrupts photosynthesis, and accelerates senescence. Both stresses cause proportionally greater damage when they coincide with critical developmental windows, particularly around flowering when reproductive structures are most vulnerable.",

    "text": "Practical Example\nConsider a wheat crop experiencing two frost events during the critical anthesis period:\n\nDay 1 (Anthesis): Growth stage = 8.0, minimum temperature = -1°C\nDay 2 (Post-anthesis): Growth stage = 8.2, minimum temperature = -2°C\n\nUsing the default wheat parameters from the table above, we can calculate the frost damage step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate Potential Reduction Ratios\nFor each day, we calculate the potential reduction using the frost temperature response function:\nDay 1 (T_min = -1°C): - Since -1°C is between FrostLowTT (-4°C) and FrostUpTT (1°C), we use linear interpolation: - \\(P_{frost}(-1) = 0.40 + (-1 - (-4)) \\times \\frac{(0.00 - 0.40)}{(1 - (-4))} = 0.40 + 3 \\times \\frac{-0.40}{5} = 0.40 - 0.24 = 0.16\\)\nDay 2 (T_min = -2°C): - \\(P_{frost}(-2) = 0.40 + (-2 - (-4)) \\times \\frac{(0.00 - 0.40)}{(1 - (-4))} = 0.40 + 2 \\times \\frac{-0.40}{5} = 0.40 - 0.16 = 0.24\\)\n\n\nStep 2: Calculate Growth Stage Sensitivity\nFor both days, we calculate sensitivity using the frost sensitivity function:\nDay 1 (GS = 8.0): - GS 8.0 is between FrostStartMostSensitiveGS (8.0) and FrostEndMostSensitiveGS (9.5) - Therefore: \\(S_{frost}(8.0) = 1.0\\) (maximum sensitivity)\nDay 2 (GS = 8.2): - GS 8.2 is also between 8.0 and 9.5 - Therefore: \\(S_{frost}(8.2) = 1.0\\) (maximum sensitivity)\n\n\nStep 3: Calculate Daily Frost Reduction Ratios\nDay 1: \\(R_{frost}(1) = P_{frost}(-1) \\times S_{frost}(8.0) = 0.16 \\times 1.0 = 0.16\\) (16% yield loss)\nDay 2: \\(R_{frost}(2) = P_{frost}(-2) \\times S_{frost}(8.2) = 0.24 \\times 1.0 = 0.24\\) (24% yield loss)\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate Cumulative Frost Damage\nThe cumulative frost reduction after both events is:\n\\[R_{frost,\\ cum}(2) = 1 - \\prod_{i=1}^{2} (1 - R_{frost}(i))\\]\n\\[R_{frost,\\ cum}(2) = 1 - [(1 - 0.16) \\times (1 - 0.24)]\\]\n\\[R_{frost,\\ cum}(2) = 1 - [0.84 \\times 0.76] = 1 - 0.6384 = 0.3616\\]\n\n\nStep 5: Calculate Final Yield Impact\nIf the potential wheat yield was 5000 kg/ha (500 g/m²), the frost-limited yield would be:\n\\[Y_{frost} = Y \\times (1 - R_{frost,\\ cum}) = 500 \\times (1 - 0.3616) = 500 \\times 0.6384 = 319.2 \\text{ g/m²}\\]\nResult: The two frost events result in a cumulative yield loss of 36.2%, reducing the potential yield from 5000 kg/ha to 3192 kg/ha.\nThis example demonstrates how:\n\nMultiple frost events have multiplicative (not additive) effects\nThe timing during the sensitive period (anthesis) maximizes damage\nColder temperatures cause proportionally more damage\nThe cumulative effect (36.2%) is less than the sum of individual events (16% + 24% = 40%)",

Where appropriate, equations or conceptual summaries are provided to explain how the process operates within the APSIM Next Generation framework.\n\n\nCalculation of Storage Nitrogen Demand\nThe function calculates storage nitrogen demand through the following steps:\nStep 1: Calculate Potential Biomass\nThe potential biomass after allocation is the sum of live biomass at the previous day (\\(DM_{\\text{Live}, i-1}\\)) and the potential dry matter allocation to the organ (\\(A_{\\text{P}, i}\\)):\n\\[\nDM_{\\text{Potential}, i} = DM_{\\text{Live}, i-1} + A_{\\text{P,Structural}, i} + A_{\\text{P,Metabolic}, i}\n\\]\nWhere \\(A_{\\text{P}, i}\\) consists of potential structural and metabolic allocation.\nStep 2: Calculate Maximum Nitrogen Content\nThe maximum nitrogen content at day \\(i\\) is based on the maximum N concentration (\\(C_{\\text{N, max}}\\)):\n\\[\nN_{\\text{Max}, i} = C_{\\text{N, max}} \\times DM_{\\text{Potential}, i}\n\\]\nStep 3: Calculate Nitrogen Deficit\nThe nitrogen deficit represents the gap between maximum potential N and current N content:\n\\[\nN_{\\text{Deficit}} = \\max(0, N_{\\text{Max}, i} - N_{\\text{Live}, i-1})\n\\]\nThis deficit is then modulated by the nitrogen demand switch:\n\\[\nN_{\\text{Deficit,Adjusted}} = N_{\\text{Deficit}} \\times \\text{nitrogenDemandSwitch}\n\\]\nStep 4: Calculate Storage Nitrogen Demand\nThe final storage nitrogen demand is the adjusted deficit minus the structural and metabolic demands:\n\\[\nD_{\\text{N, Storage}} = \\max(0, N_{\\text{Deficit,Adjusted}} - D_{\\text{N, Structural}} - D_{\\text{N, Metabolic}})\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(D_{\\text{N, Storage}}\\): Nitrogen demand for storage at day \\(i\\) (g N/m²).\n\\(N_{\\text{Max}, i}\\): Maximum nitrogen content based on maximum N concentration at day \\(i\\) (g N/m²).\n\\(N_{\\text{Live}, i-1}\\): Current nitrogen content in the live biomass at the previous day (g N/m²).\n\\(D_{\\text{N, Structural}}\\): Nitrogen demand for structural functions at day \\(i\\) (g N/m²).\n\\(D_{\\text{N, Metabolic}}\\): Nitrogen demand for metabolic functions at day \\(i\\) (g N/m²).\n\\(C_{\\text{N, max}}\\): Maximum nitrogen concentration (g N/g DM).\n\\(DM_{\\text{Potential}, i}\\): Potential dry matter after allocation (g DM/m²).\n\n\n\nBiological Interpretation\nStorage nitrogen represents nitrogen that can be remobilized during grain filling or other developmental phases. This function ensures that organs accumulate nitrogen up to their maximum capacity during periods of high nitrogen availability, which can then be utilized during periods of high demand (e.g., grain filling) or low supply.\nFor example, in wheat, the stem’s nitrogen demand is typically switched on from emergence to maximum grain length stages, and switched off afterwards. During active growth, the stem accumulates storage nitrogen that will be remobilized to support grain filling.",

This interface abstracts the complexity of the model tree structure, offering intuitive methods for finding child models, parent models, siblings, and models in scope. It also provides powerful locator functionality for accessing model properties and variables using path-based notation, similar to file system navigation.\nModels receive an IStructure instance through dependency injection (via IStructureDependency), which grants them the ability to dynamically discover and interact with other components without hard-coded dependencies. This design enables flexible model composition, where complex behaviors emerge from simple, loosely-coupled components working together through the structure system.\nThe interface supports both direct tree navigation (parent-child-sibling relationships) and scope-based discovery (finding models according to APSIM-NG’s scoping rules), making it suitable for both simple component access and complex cross-model interactions.",

This interface is essential for representing the three-dimensional nature of soil properties and processes in a one-dimensional framework, where vertical variation is explicitly modeled while horizontal variation is typically assumed uniform.\nThe interface defines a single but critical property: layer thickness. This serves as the foundational geometry upon which all other soil properties (physical, chemical, biological) are mapped. By implementing this interface, soil components and related models can consistently access and use the soil’s vertical structure for calculations involving water movement, nutrient transport, root growth, and microbial processes.\nThe layer-based approach allows APSIM NG to represent important vertical gradients in soil properties that significantly affect crop performance, such as:\n\nDecreasing organic matter with depth\nIncreasing bulk density in subsurface layers\nVariable water-holding capacity across the profile\nDifferential root distribution and water/nutrient uptake\nDepth-dependent chemical properties (pH, salinity, nutrient availability)",

This approach provides high accuracy for modeling surface processes like infiltration, evaporation, and shallow root water uptake, but increases computational demand.\nStandard: A balanced approach with 7 layers that captures the major vertical gradients while maintaining computational efficiency. The top two layers (150 mm each) represent the topsoil where most biological activity occurs, followed by progressively thicker layers with depth.\nCoarse Resolution: Uses only 5 layers for computational efficiency. This might be suitable for deep-rooted crops in relatively uniform soils or for exploratory modeling where detailed vertical resolution is less critical.\nThe choice of layer structure depends on several factors:\nResolution considerations:\n\nSurface processes (infiltration, evaporation) require finer resolution in top 0-300 mm\nRoot water uptake patterns: match layer boundaries to expected root distribution\nSoil property variation: use finer layers where properties change rapidly\nComputational resources: more layers increase simulation time\n\nMathematical representation:\nThe total soil depth is calculated as:\n\\[D_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} T_i\\]\nwhere \\(T_i\\) is the thickness of layer \\(i\\) and \\(n\\) is the number of layers.\nFor any layer \\(i\\), the depth range is:\n\\[D_{top,i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} T_j\\]\n\\[D_{bottom,i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} T_j\\]\n\\[D_{mid,i} = \\frac{D_{top,i} + D_{bottom,i}}{2}\\]\nThese depth calculations are fundamental for:\n\nCalculating layer volumes for mass balance calculations\nDetermining gravitational potential gradients for water flow\nDistributing root length density by depth\nInterpolating or aggregating measured soil data to model layers\n\nBest practices:\n\nUse 50-150 mm layers in the top 300 mm for annual crops\nGradually increase layer thickness with depth (1.5-2× previous layer)\nExtend total depth beyond expected maximum rooting depth\nAlign layer boundaries with major soil horizon changes when possible\nConsider that layer structure cannot typically be changed during a simulation",

    "text": "Overview\nSubDailyInterpolation is a temporal interpolation function that enhances the accuracy of daily calculations by accounting for sub-daily variation in environmental variables, most commonly air temperature. In agricultural systems, using only daily maximum and minimum values to represent diurnal patterns can introduce significant errors, particularly for non-linear responses such as thermal time accumulation near temperature thresholds.\nThis function operates in three sequential steps:\n\nInterpolation: A child InterpolationMethod generates sub-daily values from daily minimum and maximum inputs (e.g., from weather data).\nResponse Transformation: Each interpolated value is passed through a child Response function, which can apply non-linear transformations such as temperature response curves with base and optimal thresholds.\nAggregation: The transformed sub-daily values are either averaged or summed to produce the final daily value, depending on the specified aggregation method.\n\nSubDailyInterpolation is particularly critical for thermal time calculations, where temperature effects on crop development are highly non-linear. Using sub-daily temperature resolution prevents underestimation or overestimation that occurs when applying response functions to daily mean temperatures.",

Each process corresponds to a biological, physical, or chemical mechanism simulated during a model time step. Where appropriate, equations or conceptual summaries are provided to explain how the process operates within the APSIM Next Generation framework.\n\n\nSub-Daily Interpolation and Aggregation\nAt the start of each simulation day (triggered by the DoDailyInitialisation event), SubDailyInterpolation performs the following sequence:\n\n1. Interpolation\nThe child InterpolationMethod (e.g., ThreeHourAirTemperature) generates a series of sub-daily values from the daily minimum and maximum inputs:\n\\[\nT_{i} = f_{\\text{interpolate}}(T_{\\min}, T_{\\max}, t_i)\n\\]\nwhere: - \\(T_i\\) = interpolated value at sub-daily time step \\(i\\) - \\(T_{\\min}\\) = daily minimum value (from weather data) - \\(T_{\\max}\\) = daily maximum value (from weather data) - \\(t_i\\) = time of day for sub-daily step \\(i\\) - \\(f_{\\text{interpolate}}\\) = interpolation function (e.g., sinusoidal curve fitting diurnal temperature pattern)\nFor ThreeHourAirTemperature, this produces 8 values at 3-hour intervals (0:00, 3:00, 6:00, …, 21:00).\n\n\n2. Response Transformation\nEach interpolated value is passed through the child Response function, which applies a transformation (typically a temperature response curve):\n\\[\nR_i = f_{\\text{response}}(T_i)\n\\]\nwhere: - \\(R_i\\) = response value at sub-daily time step \\(i\\) - \\(f_{\\text{response}}\\) = response function (e.g., XYPairs defining piecewise linear or non-linear response)\nFor thermal time calculations, the response function typically implements a piecewise curve:\n\\[\nf_{\\text{response}}(T) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } T &lt; T_{\\text{base}} \\\\\nT - T_{\\text{base}} & \\text{if } T_{\\text{base}} \\le T \\le T_{\\text{opt}} \\\\\nT_{\\text{opt}} - T_{\\text{base}} - \\frac{(T - T_{\\text{opt}})(T_{\\text{opt}} - T_{\\text{base}})}{T_{\\text{max}} - T_{\\text{opt}}} & \\text{if } T_{\\text{opt}} &lt; T \\le T_{\\text{max}} \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } T &gt; T_{\\text{max}}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(T_{\\text{base}}\\), \\(T_{\\text{opt}}\\), and \\(T_{\\text{max}}\\) are cardinal temperatures defining the crop’s temperature response.\n\n\n3. Aggregation\nThe transformed sub-daily values are aggregated according to the specified agregationMethod:\nAverage Method (typical for thermal time): \\[\nV_{\\text{daily}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i\n\\]\nSum Method (used when accumulating total effects): \\[\nV_{\\text{daily}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_i\n\\]\nwhere: - \\(V_{\\text{daily}}\\) = final daily aggregated value - \\(n\\) = number of sub-daily time steps - \\(R_i\\) = response value at time step \\(i\\)\n\n\n\nBiological Significance\nThe sub-daily approach is essential for accurate thermal time calculation because:\n\nNon-linear Response: Temperature effects on development are non-linear with distinct base, optimum, and maximum thresholds. Applying these thresholds to daily mean temperature produces different results than averaging the responses to sub-daily temperatures.\nThreshold Effects: When daily mean temperature falls within the optimal range but sub-daily temperatures exceed or fall below cardinal thresholds, using only the mean temperature misses important inhibitory effects.\nDiurnal Asymmetry: The timing and duration of exposure to different temperature ranges during the day affects developmental responses. Sub-daily resolution captures these temporal patterns.\nAccuracy at Temperature Extremes: When daily temperature ranges span multiple thermal response zones (base to optimal to supra-optimal), sub-daily interpolation provides substantially more accurate thermal time estimates than using daily averages.\n\nFor example, with a daily minimum of 5°C and maximum of 35°C (mean 20°C), and cardinal temperatures of base=0°C, optimum=30°C, maximum=40°C, applying the response to the mean temperature produces a different thermal time value than averaging the responses to the actual diurnal temperature curve.",

It also provides daily water balance components such as evaporation (Es, Eo), runoff, drainage, and lateral flows. Additionally, the interface includes methods for plants to remove water from the soil profile and for management operations like tillage to modify soil water properties.\nThis interface is essential for simulating crop water use, drought stress, waterlogging effects, irrigation requirements, and water-limited yield potential.

The maximum soil evaporation possible given atmospheric demand and soil surface conditions. Calculated by partitioning Eo based on crop cover.\n\n\nEs\ndouble\nmm\nActual soil evaporation realized on the current day. Limited by Eos and available water in surface layers. Typically follows a two-stage drying pattern: constant rate (stage 1) then declining rate (stage 2).\n\n\nRunoff\ndouble\nmm\nSurface runoff generated when rainfall intensity or cumulative rainfall exceeds infiltration capacity. Calculated using methods like USDA-SCS curve number or variable runoff-rainfall relationships.\n\n\nDrainage\ndouble\nmm\nWater draining from the bottom of the soil profile.

Ponded water infiltrates in subsequent time steps or contributes to runoff.\n\n\nSalb\ndouble\n0-1\nBare soil albedo - the fraction of incoming solar radiation reflected from bare soil surface. Affects soil surface temperature and evaporation. Typical values: 0.10-0.20 for dark soils, 0.25-0.35 for light-colored soils.\n\n\nLateralOutflow\ndouble[]\nmm\nWater moving laterally out of each soil layer. Used in hillslope or catchment modeling where lateral redistribution is important. Typically zero in field-scale simulations.\n\n\nLeachNO3\ndouble\nkg/ha\nNitrate-nitrogen (NO₃-N) leached from the deepest soil layer with drainage water. Critical for assessing environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilization.\n\n\nLeachNH4\ndouble\nkg/ha\nAmmonium-nitrogen (NH₄-N) leached from the deepest soil layer. Generally small compared to NO₃ leaching due to NH₄ adsorption to soil particles.\n\n\nLeachUrea\ndouble\nkg/ha\nUrea-nitrogen leached from the deepest soil layer.

Represents water redistribution driven by water potential gradients. Upward flow (positive) occurs with capillary rise; downward flow (negative) occurs with drainage.\n\n\nFlux\ndouble[]\nmm\nGravitational drainage flux leaving each layer. Represents water movement when soil is above drained upper limit (DUL). Always positive or zero. Calculated based on hydraulic conductivity and soil water content.\n\n\nPAW\ndouble[]\nmm/mm\nPlant-available water content (volumetric) for each layer, calculated as \\(\\text{PAW}_i = \\text{SW}_i - \\text{LL15}_i\\).

    "text": "Overview\nIn APSIM Next Generation (APSIM NG), plant biomass growth is computed based on potential dry matter (DM) production from photosynthesis, reallocation, and retranslocation. However, this potential growth must be adjusted according to nutrient constraints, primarily nitrogen (N), which depends on nitrogen supply.\nThe NutrientConstrainedAllocationMethod model determines nutrient limitations to dry matter allocations by checking whether each organ has received enough nitrogen to support its allocated biomass and scales biomass down proportionally if nitrogen is insufficient.\n\nRole in APSIM Simulation Pipeline\nThe NutrientConstrainedAllocationMethod is invoked after biomass has been distributed to organs (e.g., by RelativeAllocation) but before final biomass commitment. Its purpose is to:\n\nCheck whether each organ has received enough nitrogen to support its allocated biomass (i.e. satisfy the minimum concentration).\nScale biomass down proportionally if nitrogen is insufficient.\nTrack how much biomass was reduced due to nitrogen limitations (i.e. the difference between allocated and actual biomass). The reporting variable DM.NutrientLimitation captures this reduction, which is crucial for understanding crop performance under nutrient stress (e.g. [Wheat].Arbitrator.DM.NutrientLimitation).\n\n\n\nScientific Rationale\nNitrogen is a key building block for proteins, nucleic acids, and enzymes. Without sufficient N, plants cannot construct tissue even if photosynthate is available. This constraint ensures simulations realistically capture nutrient stress.",

Each process corresponds to a biological, physical, or chemical mechanism simulated during a model time step. Where appropriate, equations or conceptual summaries are provided to explain how the process operates within the APSIM Next Generation framework.\n\n\nInputs and Assumptions\n\nOrgans (IArbitration[]): A list of organs participating in allocation (e.g., leaf, stem, root, grain).\nBiomassArbitrationType (DM): Contains the dry matter allocations (structural, metabolic, storage) from the prior allocation step.\nNutrientArbitrationType (N): Contains nitrogen demand and allocation for each organ.\n\nKey Assumptions:\n\nEach organ has a defined minimum nitrogen concentration (MinNConc), below which it cannot support biomass.\nNitrogen allocated to an organ must meet this minimum to validate the associated DM allocation.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Calculate Total N Allocation per Organ\nFor each organ \\(i\\), sum all nitrogen allocations:\n\\[\nN_{\\text{TotalAllocation},i} = N_{\\text{StructuralAllocation},i} + N_{\\text{MetabolicAllocation},i} + N_{\\text{StorageAllocation},i}\n\\]\nThis value represents the nitrogen available to support DM growth.\n\n\nStep 2: Calculate N-Constrained Growth Capacity\nDetermine the maximum biomass (N.ConstrainedGrowth[i]) that each organ can support based on its nitrogen allocation:\n\nIf total nitrogen allocation meets or exceeds demand, growth is unconstrained (assigned a very high value: 100,000,000).\nIf no nitrogen is allocated or the organ has no minimum N concentration, growth is zero.\nOtherwise, it computes the maximum biomass based on the minimum nitrogen concentration required by the organ:\n\n\\[\nN_\\text{ConstrainedGrowth}[i] = \\frac{N_\\text{TotalAllocation}[i]}{\\text{MinNConc}[i]}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(N_\\text{TotalAllocation}[i]\\) is the total nitrogen allocated to organ \\(i\\)\n\\(\\text{MinNConc}[i]\\) is the minimum nitrogen concentration required for organ \\(i\\)\n\nThis yields a per-organ limit on biomass, ensuring growth is feasible under nitrogen constraints. This is the most common case where nitrogen limits growth.\n\n\nStep 3: Scale Biomass Allocation Proportionally\nThe total biomass previously allocated (structural + metabolic + storage) is compared to ConstrainedGrowth[i].\nIf total allocation exceeds the constrained limit, all biomass components are scaled proportionally:\nLet \\(DM_{total}[i]\\) be the total biomass allocated to organ \\(i\\):\n\\[\nDM_{total}[i] = DM_{structural}[i] + DM_{metabolic}[i] + DM_{storage}[i]\n\\]\nCalculate the proportion of each component:\n\\[\nP_{structural}[i] = \\frac{DM_{structural}[i]}{DM_{total}[i]}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{metabolic}[i] = \\frac{DM_{metabolic}[i]}{DM_{total}[i]}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{storage}[i] = \\frac{DM_{storage}[i]}{DM_{total}[i]}\n\\]\nScale each component by the N-constrained growth:\n\\[\nDM_{structural}[i] = \\min\\left(DM_{structural}[i], N_{constrained}[i] \\times P_{structural}[i]\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nDM_{metabolic}[i] = \\min\\left(DM_{metabolic}[i], N_{constrained}[i] \\times P_{metabolic}[i]\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nDM_{storage}[i] = \\min\\left(DM_{storage}[i], N_{constrained}[i] \\times P_{storage}[i]\\right)\n\\]\nThis ensures:\n\nNo component exceeds the N-limited capacity.\nRatios between structural, metabolic, and storage biomass are preserved.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Update Final Biomass and Nutrient Limitation\nAfter applying constraints, the final biomass allocation and the nutrient limitation are calculated as follows:\n\\[\nDM_\\text{Allocated} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( DM_{structural}[i] + DM_{metabolic}[i] + DM_{storage}[i] \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nDM_\\text{NutrientLimitation} = DM_\\text{PreNStressAllocation} - DM_\\text{Allocated}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(DM_\\text{Allocated}\\) is the total biomass realized after N constraints.\n\\(DM_\\text{PreNStressAllocation}\\) is the total biomass allocated before applying N constraints.\n\\(DM_\\text{NutrientLimitation}\\) is the biomass lost due to insufficient nitrogen.",

These values quantify the rates and thresholds for vernalisation gene expression under different photothermal conditions, including baseline expression rates, cold-induced upregulation, and photoperiod sensitivity.\nThis class is not a computational model itself but serves as a data structure populated by the CalcCAMPVrnRates function based on controlled environment final leaf number (FLN) observations. The parameters are then used by the CAMP model to simulate genotype × environment interactions that influence flowering time in cereals such as wheat and barley.",

It also assumes the timing of flag leaf is a result of the Final Leaf Number (which sets a target) and leaf appearance rate (which sets the rate of progress toward the target).

The phase completes when vernalisation saturation is achieved, as determined by the CAMP gene expression interface. This phase is crucial for modeling winter crops, such as wheat and barley, that require exposure to cold temperatures (vernalisation) before they can proceed to reproductive development.\nVernalisation is a biological process where plants require a period of cold exposure to become competent to flower. This phase translates complex gene expression signals from the CAMP model into phenological progress, allowing APSIM NG to accurately simulate the interaction between genotype, temperature, and photoperiod in determining flowering time in winter cereals.",

Each process corresponds to a biological, physical, or chemical mechanism simulated during a model time step. Where appropriate, equations or conceptual summaries are provided to explain how the process operates within the APSIM Next Generation framework.\n\n\nVernalisation Target Calculation\nThe vernalisation target represents the threshold level of gene expression required for the phase to complete. It is calculated using the Vrn2 gene expression from the CAMP model:\n\\[\n\\text{Target}_{\\text{Vrn}} = 1 + Vrn2\n\\]\nwhere \\(Vrn2\\) is the photoperiod-induced repressor of flowering. Higher \\(Vrn2\\) expression increases the vernalisation requirement, meaning the crop needs more cold exposure to satisfy vernalisation.\n\n\nRelative Vernalisation Expression\nOn each timestep, the model calculates the current relative vernalisation expression \\(R_{\\text{Vrn}}\\) by combining multiple gene expression components from the CAMP model:\n\\[\nR_{\\text{Vrn}} = \\min\\left(\\frac{Vrn_{\\text{base}} + Vrn1 + Vrn3}{\\text{Target}_{\\text{Vrn}}},\\ Vrn_{\\text{max}} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(Vrn_{\\text{base}}\\) is the baseline (constitutive) vernalisation gene expression\n\\(Vrn1\\) is the cold-induced vernalisation gene expression that accumulates during exposure to cold temperatures\n\\(Vrn3\\) is a photoperiod-dependent promoter of flowering\n\\(Vrn_{\\text{max}}\\) is the maximum possible vernalisation expression (an upper limit)\n\nThe minimum function ensures that relative vernalisation cannot exceed the maximum value, even if gene expression would otherwise suggest higher levels.\n\n\nPhase Initialization\nWhen the phase first becomes active, the model records the current relative vernalisation expression as the baseline:\n\\[\nR_{\\text{Vrn},\\ \\text{emergence}} = R_{\\text{Vrn}}\n\\]\nThis baseline represents the vernalisation state at the start of the phase (typically at emergence). Any vernalisation that occurred before emergence is accounted for in this initial value, but further progress during the phase is measured relative to this starting point.\n\n\nProgress Calculation\nProgress through the phase is calculated as the fraction of the remaining vernalisation requirement that has been satisfied:\n\\[\nP = \\min\\left(1,\\ \\frac{R_{\\text{Vrn}} - R_{\\text{Vrn},\\ \\text{emergence}}}{1 - R_{\\text{Vrn},\\ \\text{emergence}}} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(P\\) is the progress through the phase (ranging from 0 to 1).\nThis formulation ensures that: - Progress starts at 0 when the phase begins - Progress reaches 1.0 when vernalisation is complete - The denominator \\((1 - R_{\\text{Vrn},\\ \\text{emergence}})\\) represents the remaining vernalisation requirement at the start of the phase\n\n\nPhase Completion\nThe phase is considered complete when the CAMP model sets its IsVernalised flag to true. This occurs when the accumulated vernalisation gene expression has reached the threshold required for the specific genotype and environmental conditions.\nThe completion criterion integrates: - Cold accumulation (via Vrn1) - Photoperiod effects (via Vrn2 and Vrn3) - Genotype-specific vernalisation requirements (via CAMP parameters)\n\n\nExternal Date Override\nIf an external model sets the DateToProgress property, the phase will ignore its normal gene expression-based progression mechanism and instead complete on the specified date. This allows for simplified control of phase timing when detailed vernalisation modeling is not required.",

The model tracks developmental progress through phases, triggers stage-specific events, and maintains accumulated thermal time from sowing and emergence.\n\nA phase is a period of development with specific environmental responses (e.g., “Vegetative” phase may respond to photoperiod)\nA stage is a discrete developmental milestone that marks transitions between phases (e.g., “Emergence”, “Flowering”)\n\nPhase transitions are driven by environmental factors including:\n\nThermal time (accumulated temperature above base threshold)\nPhotoperiod (daylength sensitivity for certain phases)\nVernalization (cold temperature requirement for certain crops)\nSpecific dates (calendar-based completion for management scenarios)\n\nThe Phenology model acts as the master clock for plant development, coordinating timing signals with other components such as leaf expansion, stem elongation, grain development, and senescence processes. This temporal coordination ensures that developmental events occur in biologically realistic sequences and at appropriate rates given environmental conditions.",

Each process corresponds to a biological, physical, or chemical mechanism simulated during a model time step. Where appropriate, equations or conceptual summaries are provided to explain how the process operates within the APSIM Next Generation framework.\n\n\nInitialization and Setup\nAt the Commencing event, the Phenology model:\n\nRefreshes the list of phases from child components\nClears all state variables including stage number, accumulated thermal time, and phase tracking\n\nAt PlantSowing, the model:\n\nClears state variables and resets to initial conditions\nMarks the first stage (start of first phase) as having been passed today\nInitializes the current phase index to 0\n\n\n\nDaily Phenological Development\nThe core phenological progression occurs during the DoPhenology event. This process only executes when the plant is alive. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nStep 1: Validate Thermal Time\nThe model first checks that thermal time is available and positive. If thermal time is negative, an error is raised as this indicates an issue with the ThermalTime function configuration.\n\n\nStep 2: Progress Through Current Phase\nThe current phase’s DoTimeStep method is called, which:\n\nCalculates phase-specific developmental progress based on environmental conditions\nReturns true if the phase is complete and should transition to the next phase\nProvides a proportion of the day to use for thermal time accumulation\n\n\n\nStep 3: Handle Phase Transitions\nWhen a phase completes:\n\nThe completed stage name is added to the list of stages passed today\nThe phase index increments to move to the next phase (unless already incremented by a GotoPhase)\nIf the plant has just emerged, the PlantEmerged event is raised\nThe PhaseChanged event is raised with the new stage name\nIf the new phase is a GotoPhase, it immediately executes its stage-setting logic\nThe new phase’s DoTimeStep is called to check if it also completes on the same day\n\nThis process repeats until a phase does not complete within the same timestep.\n\n\nStep 4: Update Accumulated Thermal Time\nUnless the stage was manually set via SetToStage today:\n\nTotal accumulated thermal time increases by today’s thermal time value\nIf the plant has emerged, emerged thermal time also increases\n\n\n\nStep 5: Raise Post-Phenology Event\nAfter all phenological calculations are complete, the PostPhenology event is raised, allowing other components to respond to the updated developmental state.\n\n\n\nStage Manipulation\n\nSetToStage Method\nThe SetToStage method allows manual control of phenological development, either moving forward or backward through stages. This is used for management actions (harvest, cutting) or special phase logic (GotoPhase).\nThe method accepts either a stage name (string) or stage number (double) and performs different operations depending on direction:\nRewinding (Moving to Earlier Stage):\nWhen setting to an earlier stage:\n\nIdentifies all phases between the current and target stages\nValidates that each phase can be rewound (only specific phase types support rewinding)\nFor each phase being rewound:\n\nSubtracts the phase’s accumulated thermal time from total and emerged thermal time\nCalls the phase’s ResetPhase method to clear internal state\n\nEnsures accumulated thermal time values remain non-negative\n\nFast-Forwarding (Moving to Later Stage):\nWhen setting to a later stage:\n\nIdentifies all phases between current and target stages\nFor each phase to skip:\n\nAdds the stage name to stages passed today\nIf the phase has a target, adds the remaining thermal time to reach the target\nRaises PlantEmerged event if crossing emergence\nRaises PhaseChanged event for each stage transition\n\nSets the target phase’s progress to the appropriate fraction\n\nFractional Stage Setting:\nWhen setting to a fractional stage (e.g., 3.5), the model:\n\nMoves to the phase corresponding to the integer part (phase 3)\nSets progress within that phase to the fractional part (50% through phase 3)\n\nThe StageWasReset event is raised at the conclusion to signal that a manual stage change occurred.\n\n\n\nPhase Completion by Date\nFor phases that implement IPhaseWithSetableCompletionDate, the model can force completion on a specific calendar date rather than using the phase’s normal progression mechanism. This is managed through:\n\nSetPhaseCompletionDate(completionDate, phaseName): Sets the target date for a named phase\nFractionComplete(): Calculates fractional progress based on days elapsed vs total days to completion date\ncheckIfCompletionDate(): Determines if today matches the completion date\n\nThis mechanism is particularly useful for:\n\nMatching observed phenological dates in calibration\nManagement overrides for specific calendar-based events\nEnsuring germination occurs before a set emergence date\n\n\n\nUtility Methods\nThe Phenology model provides several utility methods for querying developmental state:\n\nOnStartDayOf(stageName): Returns true if today is the first day of the specified stage\nInPhase(phaseName): Returns true if currently in the named phase\nBetween(start, end): Returns true if current phase is between start and end stages (inclusive)\nBeyond(start): Returns true if current phase is at or past the specified start stage\nPhaseStartingWith(start): Returns the phase object that begins with the specified stage name\nIndexFromPhaseName(name): Returns the array index of a phase by name\nStartStagePhaseIndex(stageName): Returns the index of the phase starting with the specified stage\nEndStagePhaseIndex(stageName): Returns the index of the phase ending with the specified stage",

This approach ensures that nitrogen demand reflects both the developmental stage (timed by thermal accumulation) and the actual sink size (number of kernels), providing a biologically realistic and process-driven estimate of daily grain nitrogen requirements.\nA linear nitrogen filling rate is assumed, meaning that the demand increases uniformly from anthesis to the end of grain filling.

It acts like a biological clock, helping researchers and agronomists predict how fast a plant will grow new leaves under different conditions. This model is a key part of the crop’s phenology (developmental timing), which is crucial for understanding when the plant will reach important stages like flowering and grain filling.\nLeaf appearance rate is influenced by temperature (how warm it is), the plant’s stage of development (which leaf is appearing), and the length of the day (photoperiod). By adjusting these parameters, the model can represent different wheat varieties and growing environments. This helps breeders and agronomists select varieties that are better suited to specific climates or management practices.",

    "text": "Methodology\nThe Phyllochron model is based on the idea that the time between new leaf appearances (measured in degree-days, or °C·days) is not constant. Instead, it changes depending on the leaf’s position on the plant and the day length.\nThe effective phyllochron (\\(P_{\\text{eff}}\\)) is calculated as:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{eff}} = P_{\\text{base}} \\times f_{\\text{leaf}}(n) \\times f_{\\text{pp}}(d)\n\\]\n\n\\(P_{\\text{base}}\\) is the base phyllochron (default: 120 °C·days), representing the typical interval between leaves under standard conditions for leaf rank from 3 to 7.\n\\(f_{\\text{leaf}}(n)\\) is a factor that adjusts the phyllochron depending on which leaf is appearing (\\(n\\) is the leaf cohort number).\n\\(f_{\\text{pp}}(d)\\) is a modifier that accounts for the effect of day length (\\(d\\) is the photoperiod in hours).\n\n\nLeaf Stage Factor\nThe rate at which new leaves appear changes as the plant grows. Early leaves appear faster, while later leaves take longer (Jamieson et al. 1998). This is represented by a piecewise function:\n\n\n\nLeaf Cohort Number (\\(n\\))\nFactor\n\n\n\n\n0–2\n0.75\n\n\n3–7\n1.0\n\n\n8+\n1.4\n\n\n\nThis means the first 2 leaves appear more quickly, leaves in the middle appear at a standard rate, and later leaves appear more slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaf Stage Factor as a Function of Leaf Cohort Number\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoperiod Effect\nThe model also accounts for how sensitive the plant is to day length with 6 degrees twilight. When days are short (less than 12 hours), leaf appearance slows down. The photoperiod effect is calculated as:\n\\[\nf_{\\text{pp}}(d) = 1 + S \\cdot f_d(d)\n\\]\n\n\\(S\\) is the photoperiod sensitivity (a parameter that can be adjusted for different varieties). \\(S\\) is typically set to 0.6 for wheat, which means the phyllochron increases by 60% (i.e. \\(120 \\times (1 + 0.6) = 192\\) °C·days) when day length is less than 8 hours, and not at all (i.e. \\(120 \\times (1 + 0) = 120\\) °C·days) when it is above 12 hours.\n\\(f_d(d)\\) describes how the effect changes with day length:\n\n\n\n\nDay Length (h)\nModifier \\(f_d(d)\\)\n\n\n\n\n8\n1.0\n\n\n12\n0.0\n\n\n20\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoperiod Effect on Phyllochron\n\n\n\n\nSo, for day lengths below 12 hours, the phyllochron increases (leaves appear more slowly), but above 12 hours, there is no further effect.",

To access this variable:\n\nRetrieve the Plant Model: Use zone.Get(\"[Wheat].Stem\") to obtain the Stem model.\nCast to IOrgan: Cast the Stem organ to the GenericOrgan interface, which provides access to the N property.\nRetrieve Nitrogen Content: Access the N property to get the current nitrogen content of the Stem organ.\n\nThis method enables monitoring and managing nutrient dynamics within specific plant organs during simulation."
