The **Flowering** phase in [Wheat](/docs/Plants/Wheat) represents the developmental period from **HeadEmergence** to **Anthesis**. It is influenced by thermal time only.

## Overview

The [GenericPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/GenericPhase.qmd) model simulates the time between the `HeadEmergence` and `Anthesis` stages.

- This phase starts at **HeadEmergence** and ends at **Anthesis**, when the flower is fully developed.
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function.
- The **Target thermal time** is fixed as constant for this phase, with default value of 80.0 °Cd.
