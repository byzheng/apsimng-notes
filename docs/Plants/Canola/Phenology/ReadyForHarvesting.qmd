The **ReadyForHarvesting** phase in [Canola](/docs/Plants/Canola) represents the last phase after **HarvestRipe**.

## Overview

The [EndPhase](/docs/Models/PMF/Phenology/Phases/EndPhase.qmd) model simulates last phase after **HarvestRipe**.

- This phase starts at **EndGrainFill** and ends at **HarvestRipe**, when the grain is considered to be fully ripe.
- The model uses daily [Thermal Time](ThermalTime.qmd), retrieved from the `[Phenology].ThermalTime` function. But it does not use here.


## Cultivar-Specific Parameters

> No cultivar-specific parameters are defined for this phase.

## Practical Example
